ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"So review after 3 days. Pros : you can adjust screen and audio output depending on scenario. Great rgb (even though there is a little bleed through) Very fast charging. Great selection of asus apps Trackpad is good. Screen is decent. SSD and HDD included. Cons: Battery is weird. Not but just weird drainage, like the back up is decent 2hrs40min medium use (no battery saver) The cpu tempratures went upto 70°C in asus armoury crate, so i switched to turbo fan speed it was still fluctuating 66 to 70 so i added cooling pad and yet no change, the warmth was not felt on keyboard or anywhere i rest my hand but base of laptop was lil warm (normal though). My intuition is that it might be asus armoury crate bug. Asus extending warranty is weird, like $39 for 1 year and almost 3x price for two years. Other than this not Major cons.  Great performance laptop totally depends on your perspective how you feel about its features and price for them."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"The laptop performance and speed is extremely good. Playing all games at ultra graphics and having no fps drops. I recommend buying a cooling pad for heavy performance. The design of the laptop is beautiful, everyone who saw the laptop was amazed by it. The weight is okay. The best performance laptop if you get it between 70k-80k."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Go with ryzen if u have more money if not take this it is great PC
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Laptop is in this price is good. The weight of the is more. Battery capacity is good but not bad. The lighting is very excellent. But the bad thing is we want to buy microsoft except that all thing is good.

Maintain ventilation(bottom) while gaming.  Asus app sucks(1gb limit per file, laggy screen share) requires BT and location, internet, unnecessary! Use FTP apps,scrcpy"
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"Best value for money. Battery life is good. Screen with 144 HZ is best with its anti glare, I would rather say that 144 HZ is a overkill as even 60 HZ is best. Turbo mode is best for gaming. All other activities are also good. Configuration to the best is in the hands of users. Best configuration gives the best performance. RGB is good but the led inside the keys are seen annoying and the space bar is missing a piece of LED. Gaming performance is also good GTA 5 can be played at a good graphics. overall a good performing laptop."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Misleading information in website and promo offer.

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EB312TS,laptop,"Asus is not a customer oriented brand. They want to sell and then shut the doors. Make sure before submitting laptop to service center, pls ask them to open infrastructure of you. They will do some physical damage and they will tell not to give waranty.

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,The Laptop is Good in general and overall.It is very fast in boot up & shut down in less than 15 sec.The given windows 10 with Office is very Good with several update features.Several minor inconveniences are there as follows : It comes with single 256 gb SSD and in it windows would ever need more than some 50gb.Leaving that Lenovo should have created a part of 200gb as separate virtual disc for user convenience and safety of system.But they left it as single open disc.For General users it will be hard job to create a virtual disc needing expert services .This system can accomodate one more SSD for increasing storage capacity but no where details provided as required for user how to install it.They should have exclusively provided info on this.All 3 usb ports + HDMI port all inline beside power adopter point at left side.Seems like a design for left handers.Such like this provision is not convenient.For cable mouse left to right cable has to run around for a Right hander.It boasts of a finger print reader in power button but no where it is mentioned how to set it.Other than these points well satisfied with this Laptop and hope it will give expected service life.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Very Good product for this price range. 35650 Boots within 10 seconds. Never lags. Battery life is also good. Gets 4-5 hours backup. Camera is poor but i rarely use it. 256 GB is also seems less but its ssd which is superfast. I had 650gb hdd of older laptop that i converted into portable using casing.  Overall i am exhilirated after buying this product.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"I would have given 0 star to this laptop. It has worst battery backup, very poor screen and webcam.  Battery hardly go for 2 hours and complete screen is yellowish.  And most importantly Worst Amazon Customers Support. I have called them 3 times to resolve the issue but everytime they come up with nothing just update the drivers!! Not able to return as well, kind of stuck and complete scam!!  I would suggest go to computer store if you are planning to buy a laptop rather than buying on Amazon!!"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Go for something better. The laptop has begun giving multiple issues within the first few months. Service is unhelpful. And feels like the govt era service standards by Lenovo.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"The product is a overall package and it is best for the daily use , i am a management student so i get a lot of assignments and projects , i have a lot of research work to persue so i think this system has never been slow ,it works perfect. IT HANGS WHEN I TURN ON FOR VERY FIRST TIME OF THE DAY (AFTER 4MONTHS F USE) I am using it for more than 3months now, the battery is good , the display is good ,the camera quality is okay okay not too clear but again i dont use it much so its okay,"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,I am writing here after 3 months of use. The performance is only average and I got problems with the OS and keypad multiple times . I work an average of 2-3 hours a day on this laptop. When I try to open any item it open the property box. Upon searching I found out the Alt key is stuck and I need to change the keypad. I could never get peace with it after buying it.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Overall good choice at this price. Boosting speed is high, also performance is good"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Am buy the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i 10th Gen Intel Core i3 14 inch FHD Thin and Light Laptop (4GB/256GB/Windows 10/MS Office/Grey/1.6Kg), 81WD0044IN but i receive slim 3 . And its not good. motherbord is gone 15 days only."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"The customer supprot is pathetic, i registered complaint but there is no update on it for 3 days. There is no way to call customer support as when i try it gives me another number for ideapad which never works always busy"

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,No backlight keyboard as it was mentioned in the features. camera quality is just okay. It is Light in weight and is working fine as of now. Speaker output is low. There is no special feature in this laptop feels as if i paid lil extra.

But I bought for little bit higher price than its original value . That’s the main issue. When it comes to display quality, worth it . Sound quality needs some more volume output, other than that it’s Good. It’s processing power is one fine thing to get applause. Overall, one fine laptop for a budget price of 67K , (but bought for 72K)."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"1 Star for Amazon packaging, and 5 Star for product.

Baklol hi ho katai bhai..."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,First thing... The laptop is good... But I feel that the thermals haven't improved much from its previous series.. I still find it too hot even while watching movies or while doing some general work... The fans are too loud... I don't know why but the frame rates are quite low keeping GTX 1650 in mind... I'm getting 60-80 FPS in some games where I should be getting 100+ FPS.. my friend has a laptop with MX 250 and he gets more FPS than me... I mean I don't get the point here... So please read this review and make up your mind... . . . Pros : 1. Display is good.. 2. Sound is quite good keeping gaming laptop speakers in mind... Cons : 1. Runs hot while gaming or even casual usage.. 2. Battery drains out just in an hour of normal browsing or watching videos.. 3. Fans are too loud..
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"This laptop is very good in it's budget , 144 hz provied only with this device in this price . If you wanna play warzone then its gives you 56 to 67 fps in medium - low settings . Other games like Rainbow six seage 130 + fps you will get easily for valorent it is best 140+ constant fps . Battery life is poor however in this price when all is good one part must be compromised ."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"So review after 3 days. Pros : you can adjust screen and audio output depending on scenario. Great rgb (even though there is a little bleed through) Very fast charging. Great selection of asus apps Trackpad is good. Screen is decent. SSD and HDD included. Cons: Battery is weird. Not but just weird drainage, like the back up is decent 2hrs40min medium use (no battery saver) The cpu tempratures went upto 70°C in asus armoury crate, so i switched to turbo fan speed it was still fluctuating 66 to 70 so i added cooling pad and yet no change, the warmth was not felt on keyboard or anywhere i rest my hand but base of laptop was lil warm (normal though). My intuition is that it might be asus armoury crate bug. Asus extending warranty is weird, like $39 for 1 year and almost 3x price for two years. Other than this not Major cons.  Great performance laptop totally depends on your perspective how you feel about its features and price for them."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"I really need to tell this story out. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. Be aware!  NEVER EVER BUY ANY EXPENSIVE PRODUCT LIKE laptop on amazon. Never. I have such bad experience regarding it. I bought this product. It has a terrible issue of over heating and fan noise. I have registered the complain within 10 days regarding it. As it was replaceable with in 10 days. The technician has come and confirmed the issue. Then also the customer care told me that they don't have it in stock and it can not be replaced. You can only return and refund. Seriously??? And the customer care has the audacity to hung my call also. Its really horrible, unprofessional, unethical behavior from amazon.  If I would have knew, it is not REPLACEABLE. I would not have buy that at all. I tried told the customer care I don't want to go for return. Still she was forcing me to accept return. She is telling me to once again returning. Why would I do that??? You guys are not reliable at all. What is the guarantee, that the new product will not have any damage.  Also the product is still in stock if you go to buy the same product. But she told me that is fresh product. SO ARE YOU GUYS RETURN THE OUTDATED ONE TO THE CUSTOMER.  IT VERY HARASSING. If I knew you unethical you people are. I would never have bought a laptop from AMAZON."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"The laptop performance and speed is extremely good. Playing all games at ultra graphics and having no fps drops. I recommend buying a cooling pad for heavy performance. The design of the laptop is beautiful, everyone who saw the laptop was amazed by it. The weight is okay. The best performance laptop if you get it between 70k-80k."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Looks great but the battery life is a bit low ofcourse it heats up quickly as it is normal for a gaming laptop what else can you expect at this price range I think the ryzen version would be better as we could get the ryzen 7 version for 75k and I bought this i5 version for 73k and I feel a bit sad now overall it's a good product it looks are nice for a gaming laptop.
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Go with ryzen if u have more money if not take this it is great PC

This product got delivered on 28-june-21 I heard lot of Good views of this laptop so I decided to buy it , In first week of use, I got huge battery issue (battery drainage 3 percent in 1 min in normal usage power saver mode with no gaming ), There was gap between back bezel and screen show in pics, touchpad loose response in between working (video attached) , overheating like hell ,it was going 95-99C degree while gaming in normal room temp that is quite high for intel 10th Gen cpu , ryzen was reported high temp so I choose this f15. I faced lot of issue in this laptop within 1 month I contacted asus service centre they changed the battery it became little managable , asus service center don't know what to do with hinge and other things , so pathetic service , I need solution to this , replace with other (non defective product) or refund my money back."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"Getting negative reviews on this particular Laptop? Ignore them, I have played many AAA tier games on this Laptop and they all run Decently on High settings and Playable on Ultra settings, For me the RGB is the only thing I could think to complain of as it appears that a single light has certainly defected somehow just beneath the Spacebar it is a very small spot and nothing big of an issue as I don't frequently use my RGB, the Laptop is also somehow not-Bloated with just standard apps for RGB control and MyAsus app.....I would definitely recommend this Laptop for this price-range atleast"
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Well I have seen many reviews on YouTube after that i decided to go for this laptop but this is a good laptop in this budget I'm basically I love games not a professional gamer or regular gamer 2 time in a week and it has been 2 days using this laptop it is working great but it heats alot 🥺with this you have keep cooling pad for this laptop.....and the asus rog bag is best great quality......

Talking About Built Quality it's Just Awesome personally I like very much.... & Performance is also Good & Networking is also fast coz it has Wifi 6 so Network Connectivity is fast... Take look to battery life... Batter life is decent & average Not too good not too bad... If looking for best buy under 65k then it's good choice for you...

ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,good one
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"Best value for money. Battery life is good. Screen with 144 HZ is best with its anti glare, I would rather say that 144 HZ is a overkill as even 60 HZ is best. Turbo mode is best for gaming. All other activities are also good. Configuration to the best is in the hands of users. Best configuration gives the best performance. RGB is good but the led inside the keys are seen annoying and the space bar is missing a piece of LED. Gaming performance is also good GTA 5 can be played at a good graphics. overall a good performing laptop."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Misleading information in website and promo offer.

ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,So the product is really good and hands down one of the best if not the best in this budget(61K). I have been using this for a month now and I'm really happy that i bought this. Only drawback that i have observed is that battery easily drains out like 100% reaches almost 30-20% if i use it for an hour. If you are ok with the battery then this is really really good.  And product delivery was good too. No problem with the delivery and the product is actually genuine.
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,I have got my laptop delivered on 9th April. On 26th April the display stops working.

ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,The laptop is good... But I feel that the thermals haven't improved much from its previous series.. I still find it too hot even while watching movies or while doing some general work. The fans should have been a bit quieter. If you don't necessarily need an intel go for this ryzen variant here amazon.in/dp/B095KQ1G3X Its cheaper and suits better for gamers.  Pros : 1. Display is good. 2. Sound is quite good keeping gaming laptop speakers in mind. 3. I have played many AAA tier games on this Laptop and they all run Decently on High settings and Playable on Ultra settings 4- Keypad is perfect for gaming 5-Web cam is better than most I have used previously.  Cons : 1. Runs hot while gaming or even casual usage.. 2. Battery drains out easily. Anyway most people are going to keep it plugged in during gaming or heavy usage. 3. Fans are loud..  I hope it helps.
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"It's been a couple of months since I bought the Asus F15 gaming laptop.

The battery lifetime is 4-5 hours for normal browsing and work but for gaming it reduces to an average of 3 hours.  *** Remember this laptop is not inbuilt with MS office and apps but has a one month free access which is to be renewed after the month.  Overall the backlight multicolored keyboard with customisable features and the screen resolution is all DOPE.  The keypad is also very handy with good hand adjustments and the touch pad has better functionality unlike many other brands I used.  Overall it's a better choice for students and gamers with better functionality and performance.If you are an professional or an employee you could still use it but with an alternative MS office apps or buy the annual subscription for the same.  Camera is good perfect for any casual or professional video calls . 1tb hdd and 512gb ssd are an advantage."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"It is so overpriced. And I want the ryzen model. Why does it go out of stock everytime? I just don't understand. If the demand is high, then maintain the supply to meet the requirements of the customers"
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"Pros : Quick charging , powerful gaming experience, excellent built quality and ability to catch wifi, no heating issues till now. I think at this price it's a good buy. Cons: The battery charge is limited to 4 hrs in battery mode and about 3 hrs in normal."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,Better buy AMD version.. more value for money. ryzen 5 is more powerful than i7 9th gen far better than i5 laptop.
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"The laptop itself is good value for money but yes, the only thing that invalidates it's existence is its 60hz refresh rate. Put in a lil more money and get the 144hz one at 61990."
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"Best for 72k ,144hz which is greater than we excpect and display is perfect .sound is normal as all laps.The look of this tuf is really good than last version. But the one disadvantage is heat. If we use for more than 3 hours continuously it raise to 60 degree Celsius .. Atlast best one than any other"
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"Grt laptop, build quality it good. And it is definitely value for money. Can't wait to buy it in coming event."

ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I got it for 62.8k with SBI Credit card in June 2021 (Non EMI) but belive me this is my best buy product..!  I was worried so much about testing in my warranty/replacement period so i have done everything what should i do when we purchased our first gaming laptop.  I don't have high end games so i think my GPU is not working because it's GPU only worked when it got a lots of load on it..! I downloaded them and test them GPU works like charm it can go upto 100% usage.(Checked in MSI AFTERBURNER)  Thermals are fine. I am from Punjab where normal temperature is 38-42 these days and i got no overheating. (But fan noise is there when you turn on TURBO mode or PERFORMANCE mode)  Silent mode is very very Great..!  144hz display is muhaaah..! ❤️ I have oneplus 8 pro with 120hz 2k Amoled panned but this display is smoother than my phone..! (some light bleeding is there but this is Normal)  Speakers are also good and loud.  I am planning to upgrade the HDD and RAM.  Note : i don't know about WINDOWS® mode first, so i was testing its battery on silent mode with some background apps kills and so on.  But i was so disappointed to see that battery is lasting about only 1 hour or less with chrome open and torrent in background. (in SILENT mode + background apps manually killed/terminated)  I was going to file a return request BUT 🤭  when i was searching about anything to save battery i suddenly i see a mode named WINDOWS® and then BOOM battery lasting about 2-2.5 hrs maybe more and thats a great for this type of laptop.  I am fully satisfied with this..!  I should say you at last GO FOR IT..! I love the lighting..! It is built like a tank (Yeah sure a plastic-ish tank 😁) Performance beast..!  I was just buying ASUS ROG STRIX for about 76k i am little bit regretting because that laptop has great lighting but i have to consider great lighting means < Less battery on time + i have saved lots of bucks..! So i am good with this lighting..!  Once again i am very happy with this product you can count on this..!"
ASUS-15-6-inch-i5-10300H-SSDWindows-FX566LH-BQ275T,laptop,And the beast is here 🔥🔥🔥 Great specs filled laptop at such a reasonable pricing. No doubt its way more better than high priced one's. Display is sharp. No comments on battery backup as you already know its a gaming laptop. Pros :- Very good pricing. Sharp display. Very fast like anything. Sound quality is OK. RGB Aura keyboard is ❤️❤️❤️ Cons :- I found trackpad lagging. So prefer a good mouse.

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EB312TS,laptop,Light weight with great screen. Worth the price
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EB312TS,laptop,"Asus is not a customer oriented brand. They want to sell and then shut the doors. Make sure before submitting laptop to service center, pls ask them to open infrastructure of you. They will do some physical damage and they will tell not to give waranty. My laptop motherboard gone because of poor quality. They took laptop and after one day they said hdmi Port has physical damage we can not give warranty ."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EB312TS,laptop,It's a very good product at the price. Core i3 20th gen with 256gb SSD. Pros 1. Fast booting. 2. Handy. 3. Light weight. 4.

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This laptop is not working none of the command button is working
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Product delivered to me is an inferior quality product. The battery drains very quickly and the camera quality is very inferior besides other defects. Either you replace it with good quality or refund of amount. So far neither this inferior product replaced nor amount refunded to me. It is very callous approach. Please do the needful early so that I could purchase another laptop for continuing my children's online study due to covid-19. I am very poor man and cannot afford spent of more money for purchasing the same.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"I bought this product after going through the reviews....well it doesn't disappointed me.... booting time is so good that once u open the laptop the power button turns on and all you have to do is login with your created password. Once you update the windows you can have free access to ms office tools. Further,don't forget to activate the one month free version of McAfee antivirus since new lappy better be cautious. Keys are good. Camera,we can't expect from any of the laptops. I got it 36,490. At this cost it would have been better if it was 1TB instead of 256 GB. But,with all the above, no regrets."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Laptop back and keyboard are bulit with very cheap material, I wasn't expecting that after paying 37k, laptop does feel light and description says things which laptop doesn't have. So basically I would recommend asus in just two 2k extra your getting finger print, hdd + SSD bigger screen with less bezels unlike lenovo, infact this model doesn't have internal cable which connects extends storage and mother board. You will have to go to lenovo store spend another 5-10k to install drive because that cable is not available in open market. Service center says you can install the ram and SSD by yourself and lenovo says if you do so you will void the warranty. So basically a zero to lenovo thumbs down"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Laptop is okay overall but looks like the body is made of very cheap plastic and the keyboard is worst just use of 3 days the keys came out don't buy it
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,The Laptop is Good in general and overall.It is very fast in boot up & shut down in less than 15 sec.The given windows 10 with Office is very Good with several update features.Several minor inconveniences are there as follows : It comes with single 256 gb SSD and in it windows would ever need more than some 50gb.Leaving that Lenovo should have created a part of 200gb as separate virtual disc for user convenience and safety of system.But they left it as single open disc.For General users it will be hard job to create a virtual disc needing expert services .This system can accomodate one more SSD for increasing storage capacity but no where details provided as required for user how to install it.They should have exclusively provided info on this.All 3 usb ports + HDMI port all inline beside power adopter point at left side.Seems like a design for left handers.Such like this provision is not convenient.For cable mouse left to right cable has to run around for a Right hander.It boasts of a finger print reader in power button but no where it is mentioned how to set it.Other than these points well satisfied with this Laptop and hope it will give expected service life.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Overall the laptop is good. One of the worst camera I have seen, though I will not use it that much. Track pad is smooth. Battery is not that good. With normal use it's giving around 3 hrs backup, with low brightness setting. (In description they mentioned 7.5 hrs) Backlit keyboard and good camera would have made this laptop worthy."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Lenovo ideapad is super cool laptop. Elegant design, lightweight, boots up in 30s -1 minute. As of now 4GB doesn't look bottleneck with moderate browsing and MS office usage. Battery backup 2-3 hours seems OK if not the great. Ethernet NIC card is missing. OS and Office are bundled. SSD 256 GB and i3 10G are super cool, in terms of performance. I believe additional SATA HDD and Single 8 GB RAM can be added."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,This laptop is very light weight and slim. This laptop is good for students of school as well as for students for college. It has privacy camera sutter which I like the most.  I would recommend to buy 2 years warranty extension pack....
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Nice product
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"I just purchased this system for my school for attending online class. things needs to be improved is : Battery got exhausted quickly, it does'nt go beyond 2 1/2 hrs in a strech which is very disappointing to see these day. Webcam quality is not good. Pixels are distorted in his zoom /MS Team class. Even it is i3 10th Gen with 250 SSD, speed of the system is not upto mark. We have not checked it on games or video either. I have exchange it after not satisfied with previous one. Finding same problem. Might be other Customers will find better product."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Very Good product for this price range. 35650 Boots within 10 seconds. Never lags. Battery life is also good. Gets 4-5 hours backup. Camera is poor but i rarely use it. 256 GB is also seems less but its ssd which is superfast. I had 650gb hdd of older laptop that i converted into portable using casing.  Overall i am exhilirated after buying this product.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"I would have given 0 star to this laptop. It has worst battery backup, very poor screen and webcam.  Battery hardly go for 2 hours and complete screen is yellowish.  And most importantly Worst Amazon Customers Support. I have called them 3 times to resolve the issue but everytime they come up with nothing just update the drivers!! Not able to return as well, kind of stuck and complete scam!!  I would suggest go to computer store if you are planning to buy a laptop rather than buying on Amazon!!"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Battery life is unbelievable and camera too. I Haven't expect such premium featured laptop in such cheap price. Lucky me! 😆 i got it for 35k. Just go for it.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Go for something better. The laptop has begun giving multiple issues within the first few months. Service is unhelpful. And feels like the govt era service standards by Lenovo.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,It's ok
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"The product is a overall package and it is best for the daily use , i am a management student so i get a lot of assignments and projects , i have a lot of research work to persue so i think this system has never been slow ,it works perfect. IT HANGS WHEN I TURN ON FOR VERY FIRST TIME OF THE DAY (AFTER 4MONTHS F USE) I am using it for more than 3months now, the battery is good , the display is good ,the camera quality is okay okay not too clear but again i dont use it much so its okay,"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,I am writing here after 3 months of use. The performance is only average and I got problems with the OS and keypad multiple times . I work an average of 2-3 hours a day on this laptop. When I try to open any item it open the property box. Upon searching I found out the Alt key is stuck and I need to change the keypad. I could never get peace with it after buying it.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Laptop 💻got dead within a year that with very nominal usage only for e-mail checking and on line school class that's it.  Service center confirmed its motherboard issue...they didn't attend service after having product under warranty that too onsite visit...even giving excuses over phone one after another.  Importantly, they asked lots of queries If customer buy product online from Amazon etc...even don't recognise online issued valid invoices on registered products. Keep your boxes intact to give proof of your product purchase in case purchase online."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Overall good choice at this price. Boosting speed is high, also performance is good"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"It is light weight therefore easy to carry around.. Haven't checked out all the features yet but from what i can see so far, it's a great buy for that price  So after a couple.of months of usage, ive noticed that the sound isnt as 'surround' as promised... Speakers are quite average... The battery life is great and no issues with its other functions"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Am buy the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i 10th Gen Intel Core i3 14 inch FHD Thin and Light Laptop (4GB/256GB/Windows 10/MS Office/Grey/1.6Kg), 81WD0044IN but i receive slim 3 . And its not good. motherbord is gone 15 days only."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"The customer supprot is pathetic, i registered complaint but there is no update on it for 3 days. There is no way to call customer support as when i try it gives me another number for ideapad which never works always busy"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,The laptop is fast durable and very light weight and it has the power of Intel Core i3 10 Gen Chip so it's way faster then the 8 or 9 Gen Chips. Make sure that if you want the performance as mine just go for the (4+256) variant. Even if you're a very intensive user this thing can set you for years along...
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"initial first hand review... just arrived..smooth feel, smooth setup..very light. feel good. balance i will update after use"

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,No backlight keyboard as it was mentioned in the features. camera quality is just okay. It is Light in weight and is working fine as of now. Speaker output is low. There is no special feature in this laptop feels as if i paid lil extra.

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Thank you
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Not so good
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,This laptop is good but Touch pad (for use of cursor and right left keys)of this product is not adjust properly. Its make a sound of (कट कट). It has required some smoothness and fitting properly. Laptop design is good and keypad also good. Light weight product
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Got this delivered on 19th aug'20. The packaging inside was fine however, the amazon box was open from one side when delivered. Was disappointed with 2 things - 1. The weight of this laptop is 2.16 kgs and NOT 1.6 Kgs , in product description it was mentioned 1.6 kgs. 2. Battery life is not more than 2.5 hrs if working continuously , when fully charged it shows 4 -4.5 hours however this is not the case. Am still working and checking on various features thus limiting right now to these 2 points , have yet to check on camera. Sound seems fine.Video quality (you tube etc) is ok , since it depends on your wi-fi network too. I had picked this model thinking that it will be slim and mainly light weight since i use ""Thinkpad X1 Carbon"" which is quite light to carry around ( 1.2-1.3 kgs)."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"I've been using this laptop since July 2020 and honestly, Lenovo's quality has amazed me. I've always been a fan of IdeaPad's keys - they flow effortlessly with one's typing speed. Screen brightness maybe a problem if you use it outdoors but fast boot-ups and decent display quality compensates for it. At this price point, the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i is easily among the top 3 picks."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"The worst laptop I have ever purchased. Quality of Lenovo product is low. Cheap quality chinese product. LCD screen is not crystal clear. Heating issue is also there. Only plus point is battery, size and weight."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"I will not take it free even, slow ,super slow , it takes more tahn 3 minutes to open , more tahn 3 minute to close any operation, even it takes few minutes to close any tab..If you dont believe me then buy any then realise it what a mistake you did !..battery super flop , I do trade in share market, I really repent why I waste my money for this product....dont believe me, then buy and then you will write the same story.....  my phone is faster than it"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,My 5 year old laptop which costed 25k back then is better in these aspects than this one. Absolutely not worth the investment.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Performance superb, looks baclit key board everything is fine... But Useless service.. Prime service also get no attention and nobody attained on site service.. Though you paid for extended warranty."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"I liked everything except color reproduction. The display quality is extremely good, bu the lack of a balanced saturation and vibrancy make the images look dull and desaturated. Thus the film viewing experience is not that great. But apart from that its a pretty amazing and decent laptop at this price range.  p.s. This laptop has got one of the best audio performance which needs a special mention."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,4 gb ram : don't buy this even for school studies. Its too slow. Camera is also not that great .
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,"Value for money, good speed for multi tasking, Light weight sufficient battery life. A b c d e f g"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Speakers volume is very low.and not satisfied with camera quality at all i expect a change policy feom your side.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Very nice
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB0158IN,laptop,Bad experience. Poor quality.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Everything is great if ur budget allow you buy it without thinking twice. There is only one problem if u try to buy extended warranty for this on buyalenovo.com the MTM number is not valid there... this may be because it is newly launched. Hope it will get fixed soon. Otherwise you have to spend extra bucks for extra warranty. Why buyalenovo.com Because u get great deal on extended warranty. 1499 for 3 year....2499 for 1year premium +ADP +3 year Without that 1799 for extra 1 year which is much more.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Lemme make things easy for you, I will discuss various points to give you a full idea about this machine. Previously I ordered MSI Morden 14 ryzen model but cancelled it when the product was near my home because this Lenovo Ideapad was just listed on Amazon and the specs were unbelievable it was way too much for a 52k laptop especially from Lenovo. Who is know for cost-cutting?  1.Display Wow, it's amazing. it was hard to believe that I got display quality as expected I also have Lenovo legion and trust me the display on this laptop is better than my legion. No colour shift, very little screen bleeding, no dead pixel, best viewing angles. etc overall I love this IPS diaplay. Note:- I don't do colour accuracy-related work I am a web developer and mostly do coding or watch anime or YouTube.So if anyone is looking for this laptop for designing purpose. Sorry, I can't give an appropriate answer.  2.Battery life It is mention for around 6 hours. But I am getting around 4-5 hrs on power-saving mode display brightness 70%. And on full 100% brightness 2-3hr maximum. Which is good but could have been better. While coding I got 5hr while continues using in Power saving mode. Its battery life is decent.  3.Processor I am not an expert in this segment but I can say that it's faster than intel i5 11th gen. Ryzen 5 5500u comes with the Redon 7 graphics 2GB, which occupy 2GB RAM. But I didn't feel any lag nor heating issue. I opened multiple chrome tabs and didn't feel any lag. Ryzen 5 5500u gives a buttery smooth experience while working.  4. Build quality It's amazing doesn't feel like a 52k laptop feels like a 60-70k laptop.  5.speaker It's Dolby atmos which gives a decent sound.  I got this laptop for 52k I think the price will go up as this laptop comes with an MRP of 67000/-  So buy it before too much price hike. I am sure you will not regret this.  Thank you 😁😇"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"This is small review for Potential buyers of Lenovo idea pad 3 (2021) Ryzen 5500u version 82KT00BXIN and why I chose it over HP 1030AU (5500U) -  1. Its build quality is decent. Body is made up of PC + ABS (Top), PC + ABS (Bottom). It is not metal or aluminium. I had bad experience with metallic Laptop (HP) where there was current and electric shock in laptop. So ABS is good if not better. 2. RAM is 4GB Soldered DDR4-3200 + 4GB SO-DIMM DDR4-3200 dual channel RAM Setup. So max RAM can be 12GB 3. Storage is latest 512GB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0x4 NVMe not SATA and it supports Up to 2 drives, 1x 2.5"" HDD + 1x M.2 2242/2280 SSD. So HDD can be put. 4. WLAN + Bluetooth™ is latest version 11ac, 2x2 (wifi 6) + BT5.0 5. Office Home and Student 2019 is lifetime free after registration 6. Finger print sensor is present which works good 7. Privacy shutter is there 8. Fast charging support is there – charges 80% in 60 min  Why I chose over HP 1030AU (5500U)  1. It is almost 2-3 thousand cheaper 2. Wifi 6 in idea pad vs wifi 5 3. Blutooth newer version is present in ideapad (v5 vs 4.2) 4. Privacy shuter in idea pad 5. Dual channel (4+4gb 3200MHz) better than 8GB Single channel 6. Finger print sensor 7. Better Screen – 300Nits Anti glare IPS Screen vs 250 Nits ips panel. 8. Can add extra HDD in idea pad. Not sure about Hp 1030.  RAM is Samsung brand and SSD is Micron brand."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,First impressions are ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Display amazing super bright viewing angles are amazing. Boot time is less than 8 seconds.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Awesome laptop.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Some cons:  1. As this has integrated graphics, so you'll get only 5.86 usable RAM. Rest 2048 MB is for graphic card. However, so far it suffices my requirements, and performance is also good so far as per my usage (I still have to install some applications). There is no option to shrink in the allocated memory for graphic card.  2. 45% NTSC. Should have 75%. (Laptop NOT recommended if you're buying for photoshop/video editing)  3. Lid does not feel metallic. Overall poor build quality. (Although the laptop is steady, it's just cheap plastic feeling is so bad 😐)  4. Not a Con though, just FYI - 475 GB storage available."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Laptop is sleek in design, ergonomically designed keypad, good aesthetics. Shutter for camera & fingerprint reader and good utilities! Initial setup and installations were breezy. Watched India vs NZ WTC final on Hotstar in Google Chrome. Sound was quite good & deep; didn't feel as if I was viewing it on laptop; seemed more like connected to an external Bluetooth speaker. Overall response is fast & zippy - thanks to 512GB SSD & Ryzen 5."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Took a risk by buying without any reviews as it was newly launched and I'm Happy that my decision turns to be great. Essentially, this is the best laptop unfer 55-60k, with great display, amazing cores performance, effecient RAM and CPU utilisation and boot time. If your budget is between 50-60k, then this would make a great choice. The Only downside, which infact doesn't bother me much is, it's downfiring speakers, which isn't as loud as one would expect but then I have headphones to compensate for that.  Overall, a great value for your buck."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Good product
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Laptop not working properly
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Screen hang and take more time during first login
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Price - I bought it for INR 51,800. First of all I am not an expert in laptops. Basic stuff like processor, clock speed, RAM etc. is all I looked at before I zeroed in on this. I have not used many laptops. So my review is a standalone review on this laptop.  The reason I selected this laptop is  1. I found it to be the cheapest among the laptops with similar specs. 2. Higher battery life - 6-7 hours on paper which is much higher than competition at this range. I am yet to test this out (at the time of this review) as I got the laptop yesterday and used for 6-7 hours with the wire plugged in. 3. 5 star rating by the other users.  First impression  1. Amazing feel. The laptop looks sleek and the build quality looks good 2. It starts from shutdown almost instantly 3. Soft keyboard touch (which was not even a criteria for me). I have another latest laptop from dell (however its i3 processor). The feel from this keyboard is better than that from Dell laptop. Basically you will fall in love with typing. 4. Screen is amazing. I played a 4k video on it yesterday and the FHD IPS display does its job 5. I am not sure about the sound though. At full volume it is not as loud I think. But then when playing video on laptop I always use a speaker or headphones (so inconsequential to me)  All in all my rating says it all!  The FHD IPS is screen is amazing. I played some 4k videos on it and it was mind boggling."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,After 12 hours of usage I am writing this review: Processing speed super. Display quality awesome. Very good backlit keyboard. Battery backup descent. Fast charging. Elegant design. I deducted 1 star for sound and touchapd. Sound quality very good but sound is extremely low. You can not hear anything if cooler or fan is running and touchpad looks fragile. The laptop is not so strong as my 10 years old lenovo Y570. But you will really love the speed and performance of Ryzen processor.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"The product is really nice, the color, keyboard, display and almost everything is perfect. The only complain I had was the warranty policy, I purchased the product(with 1year warranty policy) on 27th June but the warranty policy starts from 14th June, I hope that amazon solves up that problem."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Grab it. Trust me you won't regret. If you are looking this laptop for study, coding, meetings, online classes, watching movies, sports n all. This is the best choice in this budget. I am not a gamer so no idea about gaming performance. Super smooth, good sized keyboard with backlit, 14"" screen, antiglare, fingerprint reader, webcam shutter. You won't get anything better than this in this price range of 52k. If you have old laptop you can get exchange as well. And if you have Amaozon pay ICICI card you will get no cost EMI as well for 3 or 6 months. 1 star deducted just for sound loudness, quality is good btw. I think that is not a deal breaker because most of the time we use headset or bluetooth speaker."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Good fast laptop at a reasonable price. The features provided are mostly found on a grade higher laptops. Key board backlight, finger print sensor, 300 nits bright screen antiglare with win 10 and office pre installed. There are few cons I noticed for example the bios auto reserves 2 gb of ram because of that the usable ram becomes 6 gb. I think service center people are not aware of a solution. But you can reduced the reserved memory to 512 mb so that you have 7+ gb useable ram.  Update after a months use: Pro 1. Fast laptop for normal use. 2. Battery back up is really good gives around 5+ hrs. 3. Finger print sensor is super fast unlock really fast.  Con: 1. Speaker volume is low. You need to be in a quite room to hear anything clearly. 2. Not sure if its AMD/ or because of no dedicated graphics card. Effective ram available for use is 7 gb."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,It ticks all the boxes.  Processing is top notch (boot up in less than 5 seconds) RAM and Expansion capability to 12 gb Display is top notch for this price bracket Build Quality is good feels strong Ports are all needed Battery Backup is really good Compact Design Biometric login with Finger print sensor And most important is Price point
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"I recently purchased this product from Amzon. But I received damaged display. I thought initially that it's a driver issue but later lenovo support team confirmed that display has been internally damaged. This is the 2nd time, I have received damaged product from same vendor. I will highly recommend to cross check everything at the first place when unboxing."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Best Laptop in 50K range, using it for past 15 days playing youtube in 4k and doing coding stuff and it is taking everything easily. Some PROS--- Laptop boots up in seconds very fast. Screen quality is great. Keyboard is good Can handle multi tasking very easily (opening more than 10tabs and no lags so far) Nice comfortable finish when carrying the laptop Great connectivity (Bluetooth/ Wifi/ Wireless Monitor connection all works fine Sound is not great and not too bad either depends on what video is playing. Battery is great once charged 100% can last upto 6 hours without shutting down. Only CON-- Touch Pad does not feels great when using , you can connect external mouse not a big issue."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Awesome laptop.. it's responding very fast.. one problem I am facing is with warranty..I ordered the laptop on 27/June, but the warrenty started on 16/June.. And Amazon support says they can't do anything apart from replacement (which I don't want, as the laptop is currently out of stock)  Update : I am able to change the start date in the lenovo site. So now the warrenty has started on correct date."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Performance is excellent. Everything is smooth and fast ( I don't know about gaming experience as I don't play ). keyboard typing experience is good .it also has backlight keyboard with 2 different brightness settings for dark situations. Display is fullhd anti glare display with good brightness. Watching prime is great in this laptop. Finger print sensor is fast. Camera has privacy shutter which is a addition and good for zoom meeting. Boot time is crazy fast. Overall it's a good laptop but only downside is speakers.and I feel we should add extra ram.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Was hoping for 7+ GB usable RAM. Only 5.9GB usable.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Update : As only available RAM was 5.9 GB, 2.1 G is taken by GPU. so if you are not planning to increase RAM and less in Gaming, then you can increase the available RAM to your other process. After change in bios setting, now available RAM to OS is 7.4 G.  Pros: It's a beast interm of performance. Initially thought finger print sensor is just a fancy add.on but I am liking it the most. Boot time is super fast. Battery backup is good, also charging is quick.  Cons: AVAIALBLE RAM is just under 6G, which is drawback, if you open many chrome tabs and few other apps then RAM starts hovering around 90%. Speakers not so good. Camera is okay is.  Overall given the price point, you won't get such a feature rich laptop"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Battery life very poor and don't buy this laptop
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"At that price it offers a great value, battery life is good , performance is awesome, doesn't over heats either. Display looks sharp, has some matte finish too. Surprisingly Dolby Atmos works great too. But it looks small, This is my first laptop, I thought 14"" will be enough for me, but 14"" really looks small, although it's manageable. If u were looking for big laptops try getting 15.6"" variant. Camera quality is poor ngl."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is a wonderful laptop for this stunning price of 52k. As usual a very quick and neat delivery from Amazon too.  Pros: Best display with anti glare Finger print feature Light weight and so thin Fully metallic and sturdy RAM is expandable Privacy shutter lock for webcam Availability of C Type port (but no charging option) Pre installed Win 10+ MS office  Cons: None.. Seriously none so far  Overall Worth the buy.. if you are not looking for a high end gaming laptop but need a multi purpose laptop close to 50k budget, GO for it !!!"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Battery 4/5 : Good battery backup. can stand 5-6 hours in one go at least. display 5/5 : very nice display quality. performance 5/5 : good for multitasking and video editing. camera : 3/5 : camera quality is not too good. boot time : 5/5 : boot in only 5-6 sec heating : 5/5 : No heating issue in normal multitasking great laptop at this price point 👍
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,I like the overall performance. Except for the sound issue sometimes speaker stops working and after restart starts working again. Not sure it's hardware issue or software. Will contact lenovo customer service and update the experience.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Few points after only a day of usage , will update with numbers later 1. GOOD: Super fast Processsor, Excellent Battery back up, Anti Glare Screen, Back lit keyboard, Finger scanner, Very light and small 2. NOT SO GOOD- Speaker sound clear but a little low, keypad and trackpad feels a little flimsy"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Washed out and faded colors when comparing with smartphone video quality. Specially notice in animation video. Red look Orange and white look creamy. Calibrated color using AMD Radeon setting. Still no use. Build, Design, performance, battery, features are good."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"For around 52 thousand, It is completely worth it when we compared to other products.  I'm happy with the following features. . Clock speed . Free Microsoft office. . Batter life."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,I bought this laptop one week ago.It was very nice for this price.I am extremely happy for this .light weight and its working and build quality is very very nice..thank you.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"favorite games, edit video, and more without burning out your processor. Feels nice, fresh, new, fast. OK for everyday use. This commitment to screen real estate gives the IdeaPad 3i Gen 6"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Good laptop at reasonable price.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Product is good but sound is slow and camera quality is also not good apart from this light weight boot speed is less than five seconds overall, it is worth buying in the price range of 52000"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"All things excellent except camera quality and sound volume. Overall, a value for money laptop at this price point."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Used the laptop for a month. Good performance, Light weight and premium look."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is really bad.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Best bild quality 60k,only low volume spikar issue, great display quality 75k , fast processor,value for mony product"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Overall a good pick if one doesn’t care about camera and speakers quality.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Processor is very good as compared to i3, 11 generation."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Received product yesterday, 1/4 of the screen has green colour..defective piece received, complained to Amazon waiting for return/replacement."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Worth every penny
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Good at this price
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,Best in this price segment. Super battery backup

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,After 1 day use good
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,I'm loving it
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"I purchased this laptop @47k (got 5k discount on ICICI card) from Lenovo store offline. I need a laptop to do high level coding, programming only. I researched alot for 1 month for laptop which best for me in term of latest generation processor, GPU, bright screen, extention slot of RAM/SSD for future use, backlight keyboard, more Cores and Threads for multitasking, good battery backup of 6-7 hrs, Finger print sensor and budget 50-55k. Technically, this is ""U"" series processor meant for low power consumption & medium to bit high performance. Go for ""H"" series of you want very high performance with cost of high power consumption (""H"" will give you high performance but bit low battery backup 4-5 hrs.)  After searching all branded laptops, I found lenovo + Ryzen 5 is most near to my requirement. Lenevo Slim 3 and Slim 5 are best in all terms (go with Slim 5, if budget allow you).  One can blindly go for this laptop if your requirements are matched. This lapy will not disappoint you for sure. Click like button, if this info is useful for you. Note: I will give my update in future, if any cons found."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"It's a wonderful laptop. I got this for 52k and at that price this is insane! It has a fingerprint sensor , an fhd+ anti glare display with 300 nits display , ryzen 5 processor which is best in this price range. Anyone confused of buying this, must buy this! This is the most value for money price laptop under 60k!!"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"I am facing problem since two months, nobody is responding"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"UPDATE : HDD upgradability is mis-represented on official lenovo website for 82KT00B4IN See pic 3. There is no possible way of adding 2.5inch sata HDD/SDD due to 3 cell battery and lack of sata connector. The disk can be placed inside the chasis bottom left if we remove the battery but then it is not possible to screw down the battery over it. I think this upgrade is not possible without changing the battery and even then I could not locate any SATA connector.  Pros : 1. Compact, lightweight and very professional looking laptop. 2. AMD Ryzen 5500u 6C 12T , Samsung 2x4GB DDR4 3200 dual channel RAM and Micron 512 GB pcie SSD is more than enough for all day to day tasks. 3. 300 nits screen, Backlit Keyboard, 2x2 wifi 5, super-fast fingerprint sensor. 4. Low demanding games can be played using integrated graphics. 5. Lifetime MS office 2019 is a great add-on. Cons: 1. No aesthetic advantage over i3 model which is at 44k. Atleast the battery could have been bigger. 2. Touchpad clicks give flimsy feeling. But taps and sensitivity are OK. 3. 0.9MP 720p Webcam quality is below average. 4. Exhaust Vents are behind screen's bottom edge which would result in less optimum airflow. Upgradability : Since one ram slot is soldered with 4gb stick, only one can be upgraded upto 8gb. It also has a 2.5 inch sata slot which can be fitted with a cheap sata SSD. PCIe ssd can also be upgraded to a standard 2280 if needed. Battery backup is average 3-5 hours depending on the workload. At 52k , this is much higher value than same model with i5 11th gen which costs 58k but has a larger 15.6"" screen. AMD version has 2 extra physical cores and at-par graphics performance. I recommend this laptop for everyone who isn't a hardcore gamer."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The build quality of the laptop seems good, it's sturdy in hands and the hinges seem good when opening and closing. Light weight so easy to carry around. Looks sleek and premium. The display is really good, anti glare will reduce eye strain and the 300nits IPS panel delivers a great view. The keyboard quality seems great with soft keys that are the delight for typing. The power button in separate from the keyboard which I really like. The backlit feature looks good is available in 3 brightness levels. Press fn+space bar to change the brightness. Touchpad is good and sensitive but not the best. Camera quality is average. Privacy shutter at this price is a good deal. The speakers are placed downwards so sound is a little low but clear. Sound is not very low though, good enough for daily use. The laptop is really fast thanks to ryzen 5 5000 series processor. Day to day tasks can be done smoothly without any lag. Battery performance is good. MS Office for lifetime. McAfee 1 month trial. Lenovo vantage monitors the device for the well being of the laptop and reports all updates, battery condition and warranty period. Register on the Lenovo website for warranty. At first they'll show warranty starts from June 14th(might vary from unit to unit) but no worries you can change the date. Enter the correct date and upload the bill from the Amazon website, along with the ss of the delivery date. This will help you start the warranty period from the day the unit was delivered to you. Hope this was helpful!"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Everything looks really great,the screen quality and the build is really good except the loudness of the speaker can't even hear anything, can't produce half the loudness created by hp14 ryzen 3 5500u"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82KT00BXIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is very initial impression after just a day of usage. I already used it for 6-8 hours. Battery backup is good. Around 4-5 hours in a single charge. The display is very good at this price range. Bezels arw so thin. The privacy shutter for the webcam will be so useful. This laptop is very lightweight at just 1.4kgs. fingerprint is as fast as a mobile device's fingerprint scanner. Chargind speed is good as well. As far as speed is concerned, I faced no problem. I am not gonna use it for gaming though. 2 stage backlight configuration is available. Speaker is okayish but almost all laptop are mediocre at this price range.webcam quality is okayish as well. In this price segment we cant expect more. Do visit Ozone Tech youtube channel to find unboxing videos. I ll update this review once I use the laptop enough."

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"check the detail description, the CPU speed is just 1.2 GHz, it is a very slow laptop. It does not matter how much RAM and Hard disk of your laptop, until CPU frequency is not good, no use of them. I hope it is useful for you before buying it."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"The laptop is not working properly. The issues are the following: 1. Caps key does not work 2. Very slow trackpad/ cursor 3. Automatically restarts even if I don't press the start button  When I called customer care for refund, they didn't address the issue and kept me on a loop. Worst customer experience."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"This laptop is indeed stylish, slim and good looking with an average battery life and satisfying performance for normal usage like online lectures and so on... The display is too good but not completely anti glare. But completely disappointed with charging adapter. It doesn't seem like a travel adapter and yes it is too bulky to carry around. The fingerprint sensor and the camera is a disgrace. The fingerprint sensor not compatible with the current operating system. Overall this laptop is quite okay and it deserves a 3.5 rating. *Bonus: Great metallic texture andsmooth body and attractive silver color!"

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"After so many research on internet I brought this laptop finally. It's a full a great with in 35k of budget. You can't get 8 gb ram laptop with i3 10th gen in this budget it's jst came in new stock last week. It's also has full hd anti glare display with 15.6 inch screen almost 70% screen to body ratio. All best in class with this budget. Only one cons I got, there is no lan port. It's 2020 after all, we all have wifi I hope it's not a big cons you can ignore it."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"This is an awful product, please don’t buy fullaa waste of money. Don’t expect such a low quality product from Lenevo. I bought this for my nephew, and now regret it. Amazon customer service is very bad, didn’t expect this from Amazon. Battery life is less than 2 hours , camera is also a big let down. Doesn’t come with ms office too. Dont recommend this , please go for similar product from other brand."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"A Budget Laptop. Overall it's an awesome product from Lenovo. I'll recommend this one, for basic work purpose."

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"I had previously Lenovo D450 very old laptop but that i felt comparetively more faster than what i have. That was just 3 gb ram, 32 bit processor. The current one Core 3I with 8 GB Ram, 64, bit i will it is not quick as should be.  Overall i can suggest it is suitable for kids online classes or just personal email and other browsing purposes. But is not recommended for office related activities."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I have a complaint regarding the working of this laptop. It's light is blinking constantly even when the laptop is completely off. Also when we power on the laptop, even after pressing enter tab twice, password bar is not appearing and hence I am not able to operate the device further. Kindly send a technician to look into this matter or proceed with the exchange of item."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"// BEWARE OF CHEAP TRICKS ON AMAZON // As per images the laptop external exposure is plastic body, when asked Amazon about it they are saying the description says its platinum grey colour not body. The product is non returnable only applicable for replacement in 7 days in case of defective piece received. Product is not slim only one inch at the borders is curved slim. product may be useful as per configuration but mark downs by the physical appearance. Product axis in in plastic made hence you can imagine how long the product may last i dont like the product its not upto mark and want to return but Amazon cant make this possible"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"Hi, Reviewing it after using it for 2 days. I'll not suggest to buy this product. It's not worth to buy it, rather you can go ahead with other products available in market. The battery back up is hardly 1 hr. It's taking too much time to restart. I just purchased it because I've used lenovo laptop. That was very sturdy. But this is the worst model."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"Don't expect to do any gaming besides card games. But if you're using it for productivity purposes like MS Office, OpenOffice etc, this is all you need. Don't buy this if you're doing heavy video editing or graphics-heavy work. Battery capacity is disappointing especially these days when most laptops can do a minimum of 6 hours. You'll be lucky to get 4 hours of backup time on this one. Maybe a little more if you reduce the brightness of the screen. Overall it is a decent machine for the price."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"The laptop is thin including the power adaptor , light weight and budget friendly but sadly there ends the pros. Seems the i3 processor is too slow for windows 10, it takes its own sweet time to boot up, visible lag while opening the applications inspite of 8gb ram. May be suitable for people having good patience and not heavy usage"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,This laptop has all the feature it has mentioned here. Battery with full charge gives maximum 5 hours back up. It is really very slim and light weight. All its port are on left side which is problematic some time. It takes longer to fully start the laptop and but shut down is quick. IT DOESN'T HAVE ETHERNET PORT. I agree that it is also not mentioned in the product description but laptop worth 40K must have this feature. If you want to use any LAN Cable buy and ethernet USB port for ₹750. Overall you can find better option in comparision to this product.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"This should be the best deal I would have got at this price range. My need is connection to office network, internet surfing and basic domestic operations. The laptop is a perfect choice. It is extensively light weight. Even lighter than my other 14 inch laptop. Glad to have purchased it since over a month already."
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"My 5 years old daughter is using for her online classes, but its battery does last for 2 hours. It drained within 1 hours 30 mins.

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Value for money. Good to have separate buttons for PgUP down etc. They are on the Num Pad. Numpad as such wasn't necessary in my view.  Doesn't have the keyboard light. That would be desirable.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Look wise a beautiful metal body. Screen display is beautiful and watched few 4k videos and results are awesome. Comes with windows 10 but doesn't have ms office. In this drive we can expect that. Battery backup is not so great. Overall a beautiful and good laptop in this price range which work flawless for moderate work.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Query raised three times. Technician time slot fixed three times. Nobody attended. Keyboard is malfunctioning.
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Don't buy this product battery life is worst

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"Absolute trash. And the service is worse. Bought this in urgency for the kid’s exams. It stopped working in one week! It’s been more than two weeks now that it has been with the service Center and apparently the mother board has had to be replaced, the key board is replaced and the hinge joining the screen is to be replaced. What the the hell did Lenovo sell me? A piece of trash?? And the service Center people don’t respond, don’t pick calls, have no clue as to what is happening or when we can expect it back. An absolute waste of my money"
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"This laptop has the worse problems ever. Shuts down anytime, camera is not working sometimes, the processor is slower than a snail. Battery life is worse than a 2G micromax phone.  Hangs like anything. Please don't buy this."

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,Everything is ok and worth but while switch it on it performs quite slow also bottom bezel finishing is not up to the mark. Battery runs up to 3 hours. Overall it's still best in the market. Worth buying. Lookwise it's pretty enough. Slim fit look. Choice is yours . Budget laptop under 35k
Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"Dont buy, waste. When I buy this it is very well fast, after one month it became slow and batter life is 1h 30min . After some month it become very slow, it is take 10 - 15 to start."

Lenovo-Graphics-Warranty-Platinum-81WB015JIN,laptop,"I'll be real honest with you guys on this laptop. I bought the 14 inch version from a local store in hope of getting better battery life due to lower screen size. Let's come straight to the point, is this laptop worth buying?  Short Answer. NO!!.  But taking into consideration of current lack of choices due to CORONA impact, we can't turn down this deal. I have gone through all the reviews before buying it and after using it this is my opinion.  -Battery life claimed by company is like 5hrs and in my usage I got around 3hrs if not less. -Laptop is not that light weight considering the slim tag it has. But you can easily carry around in your backpack. -Performance wise its good enough but you would have to keep it on performance mode for good performance, but that does comes at a cost of battery backup. -Build quality not great, plastic build feels rather cheap. -Acceptable sound quality -Keyboard usable  Should we go this? -I would highly recommend that you go for the SSD version as it really makes a difference when it comes to day to day performance. Otherwise if its not in stock or its too expensive, go for this one . It would get the job done.  Other options. --> You also get a DELL laptop in this range ,which in my opinion is better, You can find it here ..... Just so that you know, Its is 14inch laptop.  I hope it helps."

Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,Review after 3 days use. Performance: Excellent for office work Battery: Excellent Design : Good build quality Sound Quality: Above Average Screen Quality : Average(Not a color rich display.)But HD movies have fairly good clarity. Reducing 1 star for this.  Bought it for my office work and for my kid's classes. So far I strongly believe that it would serve the purpose. Will update the review after a couple of months.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,Worst camera quality at this price range they gave 1998 yr vga camera. Speakers because differently in virtual calls. Poor plastic body. Pgup & pgDn buttons are secondary keys so need to press each time fn key & cltr+fn+Pgup for moving tabs worst design from Lenova for office use n browsing. They sell for 36k initially now increased to 40k
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,Light wait and very smoothly processing
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,"At this price it's a good buy, I brought it as my old laptop was dead. This cost is economic with fair features... Camera quality is good I got it office 2019"
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,Laptop is light... Configuration point of view ... No hard disk ... Not much effect on speed .... SSD size should be more Not was a deal I was looking
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,"Been using this device for 1 month & more now, it’s really fast & battery life is amazing."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,"Good product from lenovo, very light weight and worth of money."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,I would not recommend to go for it
Lenovo-Ideapad-Graphics-Platinum-81WB012DIN,laptop,The screen quality sucks!

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-39-62cms-X515JA-EJ362TS,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  After 2 days itself the display is not working for several times We also contacted to Asus customer care and they told to drop the battery charge level fully and then charge it 100% to 3-4 times but nothing changed most of the times the laptop display won't open which is so irritating disappointed with the product
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-39-62cms-X515JA-EJ362TS,laptop,"Build quality Seems okay. I have no complaints. My piece does not have the issues faced by some others who bought the same model.  Display Display is reasonably good. The default fonts on the Windows Explorer are soft and a big improvement over the previous versions of the same.  Booting Booting speed is quite high, just 10-15 seconds at most. This is what I like the most about this machine. I bought it primarily as an upgrade over my non-SSD notebook, and SSD does speed it up quite a bit — the difference is noticeable.  The biometric reader works like a charm and you get to use the machine in a jiffy after that.  Setting up MS Office Was quite quick, by following the instructions.  Registration with Asus You can also register the device to avail the Asus warranty, online.  Keyboard The keyboard is chiclet, with numeric keypad. The keys are neither too soft nor too hard, and actually I find the keyboard quite pleasant to use.  However, unlike earlier machines, this one has the Home, Page Up, Page Down and End buttons on the bottom row, and the Num Lock key position is unlike earlier notebooks, as seen in screenshot. For those used to the Home Page Up etc buttons at the top of the rows, this is cumbersome.  In earlier machines, one could press Ctrl and Home together to go to the top of the page/screen. But in this notebook, you have to press fn key (in the keys in the bottom row) + Home. This too is quite inconvenient.  A tip for users: This fn key is a toggle key - by pressing you can alternate between Ctrl and otherwise.  Even more cumbersome is the placement of the Num Lock key. Even after nearly 3 weeks of use, I still press it by mistake which often disturbs my work.  Body Body of the user area - keyboard primarily - is smooth and without texture, unlike older notebook. This is another positive. However the silver colour of the body actually puts users at a disadvantage vs. black keyboards. The keys on this notebook can't easily be seen, and since the keyboard isn't backlit, you have to compulsorily put on a light above or near the notebook, if you want to work or type something.  Computing Speed I am quite satisfied with the speed. Though I am not at all into Gaming, I still think I am a heavy user. By virtue of my profession, I typically have about 30 tabs of the Chrome browser open at all times, plus a few tabs of Edge browser. I use Excel extensively, and usually have a couple of spreadsheets open, always. In spite of such heavy use, I don't think I found the notebook to have slowed down so far. A big relief for me. Even the search by file name in Windows Explorer is quite quick. I have like 20,000 files and around 300 GB data on the notebook, so this is something.  Battery life Battery unfortunately is underwhelming. I am not happy with the battery life, which seems more like a couple of hours, maybe 3 at most. Also I happened to choose a setting which restricted charging of the battery at 60% with a view to extend battery life, and now I am unable to change this setting.  Heating I did notice the keyboard/body heat up a bit when charging. Hope this won't become a nagging issue, going ahead.  Delivery experience 1 star only. Order was placed on 30/7 but delivery only on 9th August, in spite of initial date of 6th August. So delivery took all of 10 days, in spite of repeatedly following up with Amazon. Very disappointed with Amazon for this.  Verdict I think that with an i3 processor, 8GB RAM and 512 GB SSD, this is an excellent machine - not just for students, but even professionals.  I bought this for Rs 39,990. The machine was in high demand and I somehow managed to place the order when I could see it in Amazon's inventory. I carried out extensive research on the internet and found this to be the least expensive model, for its config.  You won't regret buying this. A notebook with same config, but with i5 processor costs 8-10K more. Even notebooks by other brands with the same config incl. i3, are a lot more expensive.  Overall, my rating is 4. I reduced one star on account of the battery life."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-39-62cms-X515JA-EJ362TS,laptop,It has one of the best features at the price. Intel octane ssd 500gb and 8 gb ddr4 ram with hd screen and very loud sound. The vga web cam of some 620x480 is the only low feature which they could have upgraded with 2000 rs increase.

Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700J0IH,laptop,"Laptop is ok for me as the purpose was online education for my Kids. However, I am disappointed with the camera. With all meetings and classes online, laptops should consider a better quality camera. With this heavy Windows 10, 4GB RAM is crying with just a couple of browser windows and Teams application in the background. Overall, the performance is just ok. With correct expectation, the engine should please you. Good luck !!"
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700J0IH,laptop,"The processing speed is slow, Screen resolution, camera, build quality everything is great except the processor,battery is life about 3-4hours, it can capable of running lot of apps, you can buy it for light work and gaming"
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700J0IH,laptop,Camera quality is not good. Doesn't help you in these work from home situations where most of your meetings are through zoom or Google
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700J0IH,laptop,Came in good condition but I have few complaints: 1. Battery life: it says 3hours but within a minute 5% battery is lost 2. Slow processing: it takes 10 mins to open any browser & 5 minutes to refresh 3. Sound quality: sometimes the sound cracks like it is going to blast  Pros: 1. Big storage 2. Decent camera quality 3. Light weight  As I am preparing for competitive exam I need huge space as well as good battery life so I will probably exchange it. Also we buy laptops for a long run so investing in a quality product must be well concernes.  Good luck!

Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"First of all it looks super premium. Searched for laptop for almost a week. My requirements were 8 gb ram, SSD not HD , best display, fast booting, loaded with Windows and MS Office. I got lot of options but nearly all were above 42k but this is 38490. With card discount of 2k. And one more positive point is Intel i310th gen processor. Bought this for kid as he has online classes. Battery last 2 to 3 hrs depending on usage. So good. I can easily recommend this as this was launched in April 2020. So go for it guys."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Overall okay laptop in the price range. Pros: pretty fast operation with 8gb ram, slim design, lightweight at 1.6kg, finger/voice recognition, camera with privacy shutters Cons: very poor battery life. With proper internet connectivity, it only lasts upto 4 hours on an average while claiming to be working till 7.5 hours. Also, I personally do not like non-metallic keyboard--so that's another negative for me. Also, poor VGA-quality camera. Sound is also not that great. I have used hp throughout my life from different ranges. In my experience, by far, this is the worst laptop regarding sound.  Given the price range, it is okay for someone who uses laptop strictly for official/academic purposes. Not sure if the battery will last if one opts to watch a movie or videos for a longer time. Hope this helps."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Thanks Amazon for a timely and safe delivery during this situation. The laptop is premium in look. Smooth in Operation. Preinstalled windows and office are very helpful. it's a great choice for medium user as I feel after two to three days of it's use. Regarding specs you can see in the product page. Only thing is that core i3 tenth generation processor with 8 GB RAM is a fabulous combination. That's all for this period.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Pros: Sturdy build/ keyboard with big keys friendly to kiss and elderly Comes preinstalled with licensed windows and online free office. 8Gb RAM, 250 SSD performance makes sure we take the best of the smaller i3 gen processor. Screen brightness and display quality at par with my 1.7L HP laptop against sunlight USB 3 ports run fast as expected  Cons: Camera is below expectation, like were in early 90s /vga level The bottom plastic cover looks very old/cheap does not match the top and keyboard layout/ premium look. Audio is not very loud either, just does the job. No backlight on keybord, I don't feel needed for most users Last was missing ethernet port if someone is looking for backup."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Received the product yesterday, and here's a brief and honest review of the product. Positives: 1. As expected from a 10th gen i3 with 8GB and SSD combo, boot-up time and performance is a breeze. 2. Set-up is not painstaking, thank Cortana and Win10 for that. MS Office is bundled, and gets activated shortly after Windows activation (don't rush). 3. Sound quality was poor, but improved after updates and installation of Dolby software (yes, it will come along with the updates, and I have installed any custom app yet) 4. Keyboard is responsive with light touch keys. No backlit, but they didn't say it will have :-) 5. Thin and lightweight as advertised, and has a decent airbrush finish on top. Negatives: 1. The build quality left me highly unimpressed. Looks very fragile with plastic body that one can feel when you gently press the top or the body. 2. Next huge disappointment is the webcam quality (0.3 MP). Primary use for me is video-conf, so this is a severe let down (and sad that I cannot return it now) 3. Sound quality with the improvement due to updates still leaves me wanting for more. Final verdict: If you need the laptop for video calls, stay away! Other than that, value for money for the performance, but there are good alternates in slightly higher price bucket. Overall, for 35K an i3 with 8GB/ SSD combo is a good deal if you can live with the not so great webcam."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Light weight with brushed aluminium body. The end product is appealing but the quality and after sales services are poorest. Bought the laptop on 15th June 2020. July end the speakers are not working. Called Lenovo for support and after more than a week ie today 7th Aug, 2020 the keyboard was replaced as the speakers arebin the keyboard. Can you imagine the speakers are still not working. Now the mm other board is being replaced, ddong know by when it will be replaced. Hope such situations donot arise to you at all."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Overall good except camera quality.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Its been 7days with this product, battery backup is not so good as per their claim. on continuous usage battery backup is coming ~3hrs. Right Alt key is not functioning while I am using for Excel work (Alt+Enter). One time I have faced, Screen blurring while working and after restart it is fine. But not sure will that issue repeat or not. Very Light Weight product. Key board is convenient for Work. Over all looks good."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Most useless product. After antivirus McAfee expired it would not let me renew it - each time my funds were deducted from bank and then it would freeze. Now when I try to buy it again it starts deleting all my files. Took it to service Center who directed me to amazon. Amazon is not able to resolve it and they are sending me back to the service centre. I’m being shunted around and I’m so frustrated . Never buy this product from amazon as they don’t do returns when product does not work. Waste of my money and energy as the nearest service Center is 70km from Lavasa . Warranty taken by me is on-site instead Amazon has asked me to go back again to Lenovo Center. IMAGINE - full day job again
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"pros : On time delivery, neat preinstalled OS and Office, thanks to cortana for step by step instructions and activation, no glitches, just have some patience Gen 10 + 8GB + 256GB SSD is a great combination for 36K boots up in <5secs, even ppt, excel, browser operations are fast enough for home use. Rich and premium look, i bought grey one light weight  cons Camera could have been better, but remember this is for home use. Same with audio, manageable, not bad like others mentioned slippery surface, but thatz the feature which adds rich look, need some extra care. keyboard is very soft - pro or con ? better have external kb + mouse All ports are on the left side"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Lenovo has been a name associated with quality. Even though the laptop looks and feels ergonomic, with spacious keypad and stress free trackpad, the experience is quite harrowing. The battery initially lasted for 5-7 hours even mild gaming or video watching. But within a month it has dropped down to hardly 2 hours. The lithium cell supposedly needs to hold the juice for at least a day with mild computing applications, which has never been the case. There are bloatware in the system draining the internet all the time apart from the normal windows 10 draining. I've been using ThinkPad series laptops for years, for all my process intensive applications, and very satisfied. Using less process IdeaPad for normal user applications supposedly should have been a better experience. Alas, it's nothing better than dismal. If there was anyway to give zero or negative stars I definitely would have done that."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Got this for a supposed ""sale"", but frankly don't know the actual MRP. The printed label price on the box is around Rs. 56K, which I don't believe for a moment. Anyways, let's not get carried away by the discounts.  I paid Rs. 36,990 for this laptop, and for that price point, I see a lot of positives, the most important of which for me are the the full HD display and the 8 GB RAM. The downside is that this is an i3 powered laptop, whereas I was looking for an i5. In the 14-inch display category, this one has more features for the price point.  Positives: * Lightweight * Camera privacy shutter * 8 GB RAM * Full HD display * Microsoft Office (Home and Student edition)  Negatives: * 250 GB SSD: seriously who has only 256 GB, I would go with the model that has a 1 TB magnetic disk + a 256 GB SSD. For now, I will make do with an external disk. BTW, the actual usable free space comes to around 216 GB. * Plasticky build: I use an HP Elitebook at work, and the metallic feel of the premium laptops is way better than the plasticky build of this laptop * Got nothing other than the power adapter and the laptop. The power adapter is a bulky one. Not sure if I got conned there. * As noted by other reviewers, the webcam quality is very low (almost like they were during early 2000s).  But, for the price point and the full HD, I am willing to live with this. As some other reviews mentioned, it is a good laptop for home use (especially for kids attending online classes or for kids interested in beginner programming use)."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Bought this for kids online classes: Pros : specifications seems good of processor, 8GB ram, 256 GB hard disk Cons : VGA camera, no antivirus, build quality is delicate, display quality not good Don't expect too much... Okay kind of product. Can't avoid - made in China Atleast Dell having production in India, but for these specs cost will be above 50K"

Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"Performance - Booting up time- max 4 seconds. Excel , word opens completely in 2 seconds. Base speed is 1.19 GHz but it is extremely fast + 8GB RAM + 256 GB SSD . Visual Studio code opens up in 2 seconds . Pycharm opens up in 4-5 seconds. This configuration is good enough for programmers .  Camera - Not even started . No need for camera for me . There is a slider which will keep the camera off . No need to use the brown tape for Camera.  Battery - Decent , can last 3 to 4 hours once fully charged.  Screen - Screen is bit different , white doesn't look white it's bit yellowish but it looks really cool.  Speakers - Decent sound . Not that good and not that bad.  Only one issue for me - USB slot is not given on right side ."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Update after 8 months usages: Screen is coming out from its panel . Cheap plastic used in construction.  Customer service not helpful saying it's an accident damage and stopped responding to my emails. Atttached pics.  --------------- Best option for daily usage n if you r looking for something for kids online classes. 10th Gen i3+8GB Ram+256 GB SSD makes it real quick in operation. Build quality is average.Need to be handled carefully. Hinges n screen fitting seems fragile. Screen quality could have been better as it appears washed out. Speaker is ok.Camera is fine enough for classes n meeting. Bought it for 33k during prime days. Nothing can beat it at this price point.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Not worth
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Good laptop with this price range! It looks hilarious juts loved the way it is designed. Camera quality is not good it’s worst I can say Display is 14 in. and light weight Which is good for official use. Battery won’t Last longer major drawback!
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,their warranty is just a fraud .You would not be able to get repairs later as they won't pick calls and their technical support won't come up.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,I dont get it as my exchange laptop has some display problems. But i want to buy it without exchange. Thank you
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Laptop is hanging a lot even for normal use.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Its been only 3 months i brought this laptop and keypad of it is not functioning..Please dont buy this laptop..Worst laptop.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Very delicate
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,will not recommend for fps game only for browsing and watching videos there are cheaper option than this
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Very poor webcam Everything else fine
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Good laptop in this range.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,"I bought this laptop for work from home during lockdown and it turned out to be a really big pain for me instead. It STOPPED WORKING WITHIN 10 DAYS OF purchase. The laptop would not switch on at all because the MOTHERBOARD WAS DEFECTIVE. Amazon did not do anything regarding refund/replacement and Lenovo care has took it for repair for 15 days. So i will try to update this review after one month of getting it back. Being an extremely frequent customer of Amazon, this was a really disappointing experience and I would suggest anybody looking to buy this, to invest in 10-15k more and purchase a decent laptop instead probably from HP. I bought another HP laptop for my daughter for college from Amazon as well and it’s been more than a month and it’s working fine."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,lenovo is all time my favourite
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,Was confused due to mixed reviews on Amazon however this is not just a best option for students attending online classes but also a very nice option for regular work from home requirements (If you are connecting to virtual n/w and not using demanding apps).  This review is based in 5-6 days of use -  Pros - 1. Super light 2. Rich brush metal finish 3. Build quality is nice 4. Preinstalled lifetime MSOffice 2019 5. Due to i3 10th gen it is fast. I prefer no moving parts like non ssd hdd or optical drive so this is best option. Prefer buying 8 GB RAM to avoid any lag 6. Charger is very nice and stylish  Cons-  1. For me it is negative. The laptop starts automatically without even pressing power button when lid is open. This happens even after shut down. This is irritating for me but not sure if anyone would like this. However this is an official feature. You neee to press F2 while booting and from BIOS setup - configuration - Flip boot mode should be disabled to avoid this. 2. Battery back up is decent like 3 hours when camera and speakers are in use 3. Speakers are good but sound is low 4. Not suitable for gaming 5. Camera is ok but not that bad  Overall it is a very nice choice for simple use.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cm-Warranty-82H800U5IN,laptop,NIce product for the price
ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,"Update 2 -  - Battery backup is around 5 hours if not playing games  - Finally this model number started showing up in Asus promo website so I registered for 2 years extended warranty @ Rs. 999. The offer says Warranty Extension Upto 2 Years @ Rs.999 (1 Year Base warranty + 1 Year Extended Warranty) so that part was confusing. Will know more once they reply back.  - Laptop has good thermals, for detailed review I would recommend to checkout the review done on Venom's tech YouTube channel. Its the same laptop but with different front color and design.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update 1 -  Adding first week usage review of this laptop. This is a non gaming review.  - Keyboard keys are nice and led on them go super bright. No issues there. Touchpad was a bit rough, I guess will smoothen out after continuous usage.  - Laptop built quality is good, typical Asus tuf kind. Extra vents on back just below 2 fans and side vents too (all side vents are open) on right side which is not shown here in product pics. Laptop has some good weight to it.  - Camera is just average, don't expect much (0.9 MP, 720p)  - Audio is a bit on lower side. Need to keep system audio at 100% most of the time.  - Max GPU Power draw I observed till now in HWiNFO was 77.3 W @1950 MHz under full load (plugged in). Max temp went to 85.5 °C.  - AMD Ryzen 7 4800H, although nearly 1.5 year old processor is still in top 50 in notebookcheck's ranking so it was good enough for me. Laptops with the latest gen processor, higher on raking than this like 5800HS, 11800H, 5900HS, 5800H etc were no where close to this price range.  - Fan noise under extreme load is decent, not too noisy. Rarely heard fan noise at all under normal usage like web browsing, development work etc.  - Battery is too good for a gaming laptop, didn't test battery backup while gaming as it makes more sense to plug in which doing that, otherwise easily 5-6 hours backup under normal usage, brightness @ 70%. Battery is from Asus (A32-K55) with full charge capacity of 92385 mWh  - SSD that came along is 512GB Hynix NVMe (PCIe 4x 8.0 GT/s). There is an empty slot for another M.2 SSD.  - WiFi 6 is from MediaTek (MT7921 Wireless LAN Card) with max speed of 866 Mbps  - 8GB DDR4 RAM that came along is from Micron. There is an empty slot. Crucial CT8G4SFRA32A 8GB DDR4 (also manufactured by Micron) available here on Amazon may be a perfect fit for a proper 16 GB 3200Mhz Dual channel configuration.  - Display left me with mixed feeling. Brightness is okay at 100%. Keeping at 70% for daily usage. Display setting has two options for Refresh Rate - 60Hz and 144Hz. But display used is old, from 2019 manufactured date. Model - LM156LF-2F01 (Panda). Sometime I feel colors are not accurate even for 45% NTSC, red seem like orange. But if not comparing like with smartphone its all fine and well on its own. Matte display and good under daylight. There is significant light bleed in top right corner of my unit but its limited to corner only and not spread so decided not to replace.  I tried for on going extended warranty offer at Asus @ Rs. 999 for 2 years but unfortunately the model number didn't show up on their registration page, I mailed them for same but till now didn't get any reply till now.  So, All in all a good configuration for this price range. The processor may be old but the build design and manufacturing is of definitely 2021. Went with it because of the price point. Will try to test the thermals under gaming and the share the review result soon . Rest all is good in this.  ----------------------------------------  Reviewed on day I received -  Just received it today.  - Display is really 144Hz, although not mentioned on the box and the sticker for same is missing under the display - Battery is 90 watt hours - Adapter is 180 watts - Not Refurbished, As per the box it is Aug 2021 Import so brand new.  So, In short the configurations mentioned in product description / details are correct."
ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,It is a great deal and amazing specifications in 75k and have 75w dynamic boost in RTX 3050 with 8 core 16 thread processer

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-MW-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,The camera is below the screen which makes us looking upwards to others rather than into their eyes. This makes it useless for meetings/attending sessions... bad design

ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,This is the 2021 variant. The images in the listing is for 2020 so don't worry you'll get the lastest R7 4800H RTX 3050 variant. Just received this an hour back and the I like what I see. Have seen a lot of reviews on YouTube to be sure that the performance is definitely worth the price. If there are any issues in this laptop then it's probably specific to my item and not the laptop in general. For 75k it's a steal. Go ahead without thinking twice!  Will update more here if I notice any issues in general.

I am right now confused whether I should go for replacement or not? :( Attached here is the video and picture of scrren bleeding. I am not sure if this is only with my laptop or anyone else is facing issues with screen. Also for those who are asking about McAfee, you will get 1 year subscription."

ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,"Purchased on sep 4 2021, delivered on sep 6, raised return request on sep 7 2021. Performance is Okay. noticed few lags while using.  Main issues which I faced: 1. Brightness issue. (unable to see the content properly if brightness level is below 70%) 2. Display Screen Bleed at top right corner. 3. Color Accuracy is too low. Mentioned 62.5% SRGB, but not upto the mark. 4. Battery Backup is around 3.5hrs to 4hrs => Refresh rate-60hz, brightness-75%, Applications used : Only Edge and VS code. 5. Noticed Heating issue while using back tasks or at booting time even using it on 5-fan cooling pad.  Not expected display related and color accuracy issues in this price range."

ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The laptop is quite well built. Has a good screen with much brightness for indoor uses. The keyboard also feels nice and the RGB has 4 stages of brightness. Will not get into the performance part yet because I have got this product just now.  But one thing to mention, it seems to me that it is the 2020 model ( please correct me if I am wrong) as the logo and the lid seems to be that of the 2020's model.  Cheers !!!"
ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,Everything is great from the build quality to backlights of keyboard but the display is little irritating for gaming so if you want a clear display so don't buy it otherwise it's great worth of money
ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,"This laptop has impressed me as well as disappointed me on some fronts... PROS- 1- I was impressed with its specs specially Ryzen 5 4800H at this price point. 2- It's sound is good but not great. 3- build quality is good for 75k. 4- keyboard is decent with good travel. CONS- 1- Display is not that good because of the low brightness ( not clear visible in morning sunlight) 2- Screen bleeding is visible because of poor integration of frame with display ( I think) because when I press the frame, it improves a bit and again come back after some time. That's why I am seriously thinking of returning this laptop. My two concerns are... Bleeding issue and low brightness issue Which I think should not be there for 75k laptops. They should have provided at least 300nits bright display.. I will give it 3 star and cut two for low brightness and display bleeding issue.."
ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,"The product is completely fine. Brightness control is not working both before and after updates. It can be an issue from amd or windows side. But facing this issue in a brand new product is not something a customer wants after sending 75k. Driver updates , microsoft basic adapter nothing works. Will return the product."

ASUS-15-6-inch-RTX-3050-Graphics-FA506IC-HN005T,laptop,Till now i have played only valorant and the highest Cpu temps were 70 deg and for the gpu 65 deg. So the thermals in the 2021 modeal are good. But 1 thing u should take note of is that this system needs dual channel ram. Will update the review in future.

Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,In Amazon websize processor speed shows as 4.2GHz but am received lap shows 2.4GHz only......
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,Product is too good .but battery back too low more than 3 hours
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,The power button is not working properly. It needs double press.
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,Clock speed is not as mentioned in the description. There's no high performance mode. Backlit keyboard is good Overall product is nice .
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,Battery backup less then 1 hour. Totally sucks
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,Good battery life lasts upto 6 hours. And also it's light weight. Packaging was very good. Also having Backlit.
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,"Purchased this product from offline at ₹61000. The laptop's build quality is excellent with average quality camera and battery backup is also good, it lasts for 3-4 hours on normal use. The performance of this laptop is nice and will be superb if one installs Ubuntu 20.04. Only things I didn't like is that it takes time to boot up (from 4.9-15.0 seconds, my old laptop is much better in this), heating issues are present on both operating systems. Speakers don't work in Ubuntu 20.04 and neither dell has provided the drivers and support for the same, but it supports Bluetooth headphones and wired ones on Ubuntu os. I am not a gamer and cannot say how the performance is while playing games on laptop. Final verdict:- If your are tight on budget and need good performance for day to day use, its excellent,go for it."
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,Good lap.. very handy.. good speed too.. serves my purpose.. the color combination looks good.. would recommend it to friends.
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,Nice product is super helpful product best price for the product is super helpful to you happy with the product
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,It's been 2 days only. This laptop has heating issues. Within 5 minutes only it started heating. Keypad also started heating. & Battery backup is worst. Like within 10 minutes it's regrading by 15 to 20%
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560559WIN9S,laptop,"MOST IMPORTANTLY, its has SSD laptop which you can use for windows. Guys, this is much have in 2021, don't go for HDD only laptops. It will cost 2-3k more but trust me, its worth for the long run.  DISPLAY is not IPS, its TFT, and its fine for watching movies, playing casual games and coding. But if you want crispier display go for this IPS laptop from HP, its far more recent/latest but a bit costlier ,here amazon.in/gp/product/B08XNYN5QV . Although on sale days, they sell for the same price.  Pros: 1. Display is big and very good and quite best for developers to work because it is full hd 2. Most ports are on left that makes enough space to run a mouse on right. 3. Body is having matt finish not like other finger print magnets, it keeps itself clean. 4. Keyboard has additional num pads that makes life easy in many cases and it is silent keyboard, during night your partner will not get irritated with tik tik sound. 5. Speakers are good and mic too. 6. Air ventilation is very good instead of any side it is blowing air back of the laptop. 7. Ssd and hdd combination is very good. 256 gb ssd and 1 tb hdd. When i scanned this laptop with cpuz there is one more port for additional hard disk. 8. No glitch in os and McAfee and ms office works quite well registration was easy.  Cons: 1.Battery backup is really a concern, max 3 hours, and it is new device, what will happen after 2 years can't imagine. I can't compare the performance with Mac book because that beast is running 12 hours without charge. 2. Finger print reader should have given to unlock the machine, it was there in the previous version of this device with 10th generation intel i5. 3. Body is matt finish but magnet to dust. 4. There should be small section in body where we can replace memories for 16GB, it need service center attention to do that. 5. Bios is missing few options like laptop will get start when power adapter gets connected and adaptive brightness controlling feature. 6. Keyboard need backlit and decent arrow keys. Now a days to reduce the size companies are moving arrow keys inside and this makes me little bit uncomfortable. 7. Bitlocker was enabled by default this was making machine damn slow. This kind of security is not required by everyone. I disabled bitlocker and now device has its speed.  Apart from all this cons it is very decent device, if you are not very concerned about battery, this is best. It has one of the best hardware combination you will get in 70K or even more.  I want to reduce 0.5 star for battery only otherwise it is a 5 star device and I given also."

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-MW-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,"1st time laptop having dead pixel on display. 2nd time replacement laptop not booting on battery. Ever after Technician visit conveying power supply issue, return pick up guys tells to turn on laptop else would not pick up as he had no such information. Told me to call Amazon again and asked me to wait but he instead ran away…. Again need to raise pickup request. Such pathetic experience 1st time from Amazon…  Update: Laptop got picked up on the 5th attempt, Couldn’t imagine what would be the scenario after return period.  Update: One can go for the same configuration on Asus E410 model. Its 2-3k expensive but feels much more sturdy built and reliable. Has a 180 degree hinge like office laptops. Been using it from a week now, feels perfect for normal use with documents, surfing, movies. Only con found till now- Speaker volume is bit low(almost similar to Avita Essentials) But I compensate that with connecting Bluetooth earphones."

ASUS-VivoBook-i5-1035G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK562TS,laptop,A light weight laptop. Heating issues are there on heavy usages like gaming. For regular uses it is the best. I am managing my work from home.  Pros: 1. Battery backup came 5hrs for me. 2. Display supported YouTube 4k videos. 3. Light weight as notebook. 4. No lag/struck for my daily office work (developer using VS & SQL).  Cons: 1. No backlit keyboard. 2. No sd card reader as shown in site. 3. Fan will exhaust a little bit heavy on using any games/bluestacks/windows updates.  I don’t think these are cons for this price range laptops. Overall for 51k price I’m satisfied for my daily use.

ASUS-VivoBook-i5-1035G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK562TS,laptop,"Excellent one,u can connect your phone to the laptop and vice versa.No other brand gives this feature for 50k. I think so."
ASUS-VivoBook-i5-1035G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK562TS,laptop,This is not good
ASUS-VivoBook-i5-1035G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK562TS,laptop,Camera quality is very very poor
ASUS-VivoBook-i5-1035G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK562TS,laptop,There is no bill of laptop
ASUS-VivoBook-i5-1035G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK562TS,laptop,"Camera Is almost waste ,50 k laptop but doesn't has good camera, still Aadhar card camera is best than this."
ASUS-VivoBook-i5-1035G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK562TS,laptop,"The laptop is ok but THE KEYPAD IS NOT BACKLIT. False information given on this website. I wanted a backlit keypad & I selected this laptop because of that feature. Sadly disappointed.  Besides that, it is a superb laptop. Sleek and beautiful. Works very well. Extremely lightweight. Smart design."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Given one star because i can not give lower than this. Since i have unbox this getting the blue screen error. Not able to place return for this order... Feeling very frustrated.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"It's the best in class screen in this price segment..as it has nvdia Mx 250 so u can play games in medium settings but not meant for heavy games as this is a notebook ,but you can do light gaming in it ..the battery life is good lasted for 8-9hrs of usage depending upon your use.and it also fastly charges the laptop. Keyboard is great it give that clicky feel and feels great to type for...if you want to edit video and photo on this thing you can do it..but not for 4k video editing and heavy tasks.."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"too elegant a design...! screen quality is the highlight of the device--good brightness, very thin bezels; even my brother mistook it for the Dell XPS 13, 2020. Windows Hello works like fluid.. keyboard is also very good--good key travel and is absolutely fine for long typers. Packed with Intel's latest 10th Gen processor, there is no issue with the performance. As Lenovo's Official site says, this device comes under the domain of business laptops. So don't expect good gaming performance as it is clearly not meant for that... Overall, the best choice at this price range..."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"I wanted to buy a light weight laptop for my personal use, researched a lot to finalize this laptop. I went to store as well to check out the piece and in store it was about 2-3k more than online price and they were providing a carry bag as well. It was stupid thing i didn't buy at store itself and just because 2-3k less price in Amazon ordered it. Delivery time was perfect but when i opened the package found the lenovo box was tampered as u can see in photo. Picked out the laptop and did some basic setup to check the warranty status. It was shocking that already 2 month gone from warray it was showing only 10 valid months. Warranty start date was 2 months old which means the laptop which delivered is used one.  Conclusion : Keep in mind that you are spending over 80k for the laptop and you might end up getting used product like me. I would strongly suggest to go to store and pick up the item even thought its 2-3k more , atleast u will get brand new product. Also you might need to sanitize the whole laptop because its used one."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"This is my review after 2 weeks. This laptop is conservatively designed which I like. The specs are really good and thus the notebook is super fast. The show stopper is the display which is awesome but I wish the brightness were a notch higher *not a deal breaker though*. It's a quiet laptop wherein you can't hear the fans whirring inside. Most of the time it stays cool and I have not had any problems with excessive heating. 512gb ssd works like a charm because boot up speed is super fast. Also, what most people overlook is the warranty period which is 3 years. That is a lot of support. Therefore, you're most likely to have this laptop working and running even after 3 years. So you're approximately spending 2.1 k per month to have this for 3 years. And it absolutely generates more value than that. I hope this helps."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Delivered the laptop with 1tb hdd only. Ssd not included...
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,I ordered this laptop based on the price and specifications. Plenty of tech specs are not matching with the features promised in the advertisement/product page. Please find below a quick comparison: 1) actual laptop weight is 2.08 kgs whereas the booking page shows it as 1.28 kgs 2) the actual dimensions are greater than what the page shows 3) battery is 3-cell whereas it was advertised as 4-cell in the product page 4) nowhere in the product page it is mentioned that the OS is single language  I had to return this order. Those who are thinking of buying this product should reconsider this review before making a significant investment.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"the screen is the only reason i went for this model, coz everything else like processor, ram is pretty good in all the laptops priced above 60k bracket. This one proved to be worth the price as the screen quality is just mind blowing. Was going to buy dell xps 13 UHD model but luckily saved a lot of money with this one."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,This laptop looks amazing. If you like small and lightweight laptop then it's perfect for you. QHD screen make the experience amazing. Performance wise it's snappy and do most of the task with out any lag. I'm using it for both home and office work and it's working without any problem. The thing I liked most is the IR sensor. As soon as you open the lid it quickly detects your face and get you on the main desktop. Ports are less in this laptop. Two usb c and one usb 3.1. No HDMI at all. If you wanna attach an external display the you have to burn some bucks on hdmi connector. Overall its a nice deal.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,High screen quality. Low weight Easy handling. Good performance.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Value for money. Its USP is its screen. Windows hello works like a charm. For its price it is the best in thin and light segment.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Sreen quality -10 Battery-9 Performance-9 (not for gaming) Sound -7 Brightness-8 Cooling -9 Ir camera -10 (works in no light also nd very fast) Build quality-8  Best under 80 k (all the rarings are given compared to the best ultrabook i have seen upto 1.2lakh range )
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"The laptop has top configuration and everything looks great at first. However, after using it for more than 6-months now, I must say I am frustrated by several nagging issues that are a combination of design and unresolved issues. 1. The laptop has real touchpad driver problems! Just look at the Lenovo forums for this model!!! Both the older and latest manufacturer-provided driver has several issues. The mouse cursor keeps freezing/jumping intermittently. They keep trying to fix it with drivers, have updated/tried all Windows/Intel/Lenovo solutions, but nothing seems to work. 2. The sound output on this laptop is very soft. You really struggle with YouTube videos and movies at max volume. Part of the problem is a design flaw whereby speakers are placed near the bottom, thus muffling the sound. But the drivers/dolby also has serious issues. Again, just look at the forums. Surprising, Lenovo sells sub-standard products with known issues. I quite like their T series that I use for office work."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"This new launch from lenovo offers amazing value for money. The best part is the display, with a resolution of 2560x1600 everything looks great, with MX250 alongside enjoy smooth gaming experience. Worst part is you won't be getting any HDMI or Lan port and just one USB slot. Overall wonderful product at such a cheap price."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"I have bought this laptop in August 2020, after a great study on available latest models with thier specifications.This is my review after using this laptop for 3 months. Firstly, I would talk about negatives.  Cons: 1. As said in many reviews here, Keyboard is not that comfortable. Clicking on keys is my concern, but don't say it is that bad. Left control button is irritating. 2. Comparing the battery as claimed by company and also as per reviews here, it is good for video playback only, It gives you around 9 hours for videos playing. And for any other work it is around 6 hours for continuous usage. 3. It has heating issue now and then. I doesn't say it always heats up, but it will definitely sometime. 4. Sound is very bad. Speakers are placed buttom, that is again a drawback. I have seen that few videos are very hard to hear that you should place you ear close to the speakers below 5 cm. Hope you understand that it is that bad. 5. It has lack of connectivity ports, atleast an extra USB port will help. Though I bought it after knowing the available ports, I should add my opinion atlear USB port atleast which is a needed one. And again, when they gave two USB-C type ports, they should be Thunderbolt type atleast, but they are not. 6. You couldn't find the accessories for this laptop at online/offline stores. I have looked for Keyboard guard, Screen guard, laptop cover but I didn't find any of these designed for this laptop. 7. Finally, the laptop price for is too high.  Pros: 1. Laptop is almost as sleek as Mackbook. 2. Display is very good. 3. It looks very brilliant laptop. I didn't face anything bad till now other than those cons I mentioned above.  Verdict: I would give a rating of 3.5/5 as my review. It is priced very high considering it as an Ultrabook, but it should be around Rs. 60k-70k and not more than that. I suggest you to go with Mackbook if you want to afford more. If you are ok with the Cons I mentioned, thats up to you because it is also good in performace wise but not features wise."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Screen is amazing. Pretty lightweight. Great design. Super fast. Face unlock is cool.  It did get heated up for a new laptop while setting up but maybe because it was being charged too. Speakers could be louder but they are good enough.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"After going through several reviews, I went on to buy this one, got it @76k. Build quality, battery and performance are as expected.  However, while screen seems good on paper, its not exactly color accurate. It tends to cooler side of colors, but can be adjusted using Intel Graphics Center. But if you plan to run Linux, then you might need to find some other way to manually adjust the colors.  Overall, a good buy! 4/5"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,The overall laptop is GOOD 1) PRICE IS OVERPRICE IN INDIA 2) Warranty need to be manually updated 3) WiFi adopter need to update configuration  + SCREEN IS THE ONLY PLUS POINT - other all technology old  45k-50k best laptop but India taxes make it 80k
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Love this latest edition of Lenovo IdeaPad. Very sleek and beautiful. The only drawback I see is not having a port to connect a LAN cable.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,After lot of research i bought the laptop and not disappointed except for sound of space bar which seems like sound of a string in guitar :) . The display is too good as I need to look at the screen for my coding all through my day. we may get the same or more specs at 70k but as i mentioned about the display. Go for it you will not be disappointed.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Service warranty shows 27 months instead of 36 months. Don't purchase Chinese Lenovo product. It mentioned 3 yrs on-site warrant but the laptop sound is very less in 100% and raised but no one is responding. I am going to return this.

HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Very happy with the laptop. It's sleek, fast with 16gb RAM."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"The beautiful new Lenovo Ideapad S540. Pros - 1. Performance: Latest Intel Comet Lake (10th Gen) i5 Processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB ultra-fast PCIE M.2 SSD and dedicated Nvidia MX 250 mid-range Graphic Card means the laptop is blazing fast. The mid-range MX 250 graphic card can easily handle tasks like photo and video editing. The dual fans tend to run hot under heavy usage but ensures that there is no thermal throttling. 2. Build Quality : 13.3 inch Laptop is feather light at 1.28 Kgs and has an anodized Aluminum build, which is super premium. 3. QHD Display : The most striking aspect of this laptop is the QHD (2560 x 1600) 13.3-inch IPS panel with a 16:10 aspect ratio, 300 nits brightness, 100% sRGB and 227 PPI, which is best in class at this price range. The IPS panel is gorgeous with really life like colours, crystal clear images and easy to read Text. 4. IR Camera : The laptop also comes with an IR camera, which enables cool features like Face Unlock for Hands free Login, Eye tracking, and so on. 5. Battery :The laptop comes with a sufficient 56WHr battery, which should give you about 10hours of light to moderate real world usage. The laptop has fast charge, which lets you charge 80% of the battery in 1 hour. 6. Warranty : It comes with 3-year warranty. Cons- 1. Port selection -It has 2 USB Type C and 1 USB type A port. There is no HDMI slot or a thunderbolt port.  It is the perfect companion for the constant traveler with a beautiful screen and good battery life. It comes with some nifty features like Face-Unlock which we have come to expect from all smart phones, but has somehow evaded laptops so far. It is well build. Overall, it is a great Windows alternative to the MacBook Air."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,This thing is a beauty as well as the beast in such a small form factor. Especially the weight of this machine is so less it does not even feel in hands. just go for it.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"Super product, only backdrop of this laptop is sound had it been louder it would have been an all rounder."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"Really love the weight and size of the machine. The resolution and screen quality is the best for the price. For someone like me who spends a lot of time looking at the screen and typing, its an absolute pleasure to own this."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,good product
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,It’s good enough
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Good product
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,This is an unbelievable product at this price point with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD and NVIDIA MX250 dedicated graphics. Very smooth performance with no lags whatsoever. The best part of the product is the QHD display with 300 nits brightness. Lenovo has gone the whole hog with this product and are providing 3 years standard warranty instead of the 1 year warranty. The laptop also comes with IR camera and a whole host of smart features like hands free login. Overall a great alternative to the Macbook with better specs and a value for money price.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"Excellent display. Super lightweight. Awesome battery life. Silky smooth performance. AI face recognition is mind blowing and works even in pitch darkness. Laptop powers on automatically on opening the cover and booting takes place in seconds. Only downside is that it doesn't have touchscreen nor foldable. But at this price, it is a super premium laptop. A true value for money deal with the three years warranty by Lenovo."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"I have been using this laptop for few months now. Best things: ✓ Amazing screen quality display - Quad HD (2K) for such a small screen area. ✓ Pretty fast as it's i5 10th gen. ✓ Very light as it's just 1.2kgs. ✓ Very fast NVMe SSD storage of 512Gb. You can also upgrade or change the storage sizes. ✓ 3 years warranty that came along during purchase. ✓ Good built quality. ✓ Lower heating during normal work and pretty silent. ✓ Decent battery life.  Not great: × Memory is 8Gb of RAM and it's soldered. You cannot upgrade it. × Slightly expensive for the configuration. × Very less available ports, 1 USB3.1 and 2 Type C USB port and one of them will be used for charging, so you are left just 2 Ports to use.  Overall a good laptop with great display and if you don't bother about upgrading RAM in future, then it's a good choice and looks kinda MacBook Air ;)"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Couldn't get this item frm Amazon as my card limit is only 50k. So l got this product frm a stall for my daughter who is doing her English Hons course . Premium looking. Lightweight. Great screen. Specification is better comparing to MacBook air. 512gb SSD is enough for a student. Works very fast. Price is always fluctuating in Amazon and Flipkart for this laptop. Overall the best laptop in 80k. Got a bag of worth rupees 4k frm the seller. A value for money product. Definitely recommend others to buy...
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Why don't lenovo name it macbook pro clone😅
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"After 2months of usage  Good product No major issues  Pros: Fast, Screen display is good, Battery life is good more than 8hrs in battery saver mode, Sound quality ok, 3yr warranty, Sleek, Very light weight  Cons: over priced, No touch screen, 1 USB port."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"Not worth for money. It's very worst product. After configuration of the system used for online class. After two hours uses, system got hang and nothing is working like keyboard, keypad mouse. Also there is no indicator for system switch on or off. It will take long time to start the system."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is awesome laptop if you wanna get some under 80k; just wait for a sale and take it. If you are upto gaming then this is not for you bro; But if you want premium feel then go for it. One months crossed, nothing to complaint. The Best part is Battery, Display and Keyboard. Trackpad is good too, I have given it 5 stars cause it deserves more or same about 4.5 stars... Take it you will not regret.❤"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"Everything is good except the battery life. Initially, the laptop was giving more than 6 hours of backup. It's been just 5 months and battery life is just 3-4 hours now. So, I won't recommend it for someone who needs a good battery backup. Also, not good for playing games. It lags and heats up with fifa 18! So, only good for daily work purpose and home use. I bought it for 63k and now the price going up to 84k, it's not worth it!"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,It freezes many times. I have updated windows but problem still persists. Rest laptop is fine. Hanging problem solution found nowhere.  Solution found. Update bios drivers which is different from updating windows. For this lenovo Vanguard app is downloaded
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,Superb laptop I have ever seen... But only price is little bit high... All features are good enough... Battery life 10-11hr which is worth...must buy😊
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,"Gorgeous looks, works seamlessly, super lightweight and thin. At par with Apple Macbook Air, if not better. Charges quickly. Not for heavy gaming though."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-82H1002CIN,laptop,The size is very accurate as the laptop doesn't feel bulky at all and performance is good

Lenovo-Laptop-Warranty-1-85Kg-82C6000LIH,laptop,"I bought this laptop in August 2021 and writing this review after using it for 40 days. This laptop is a good buy for me with some exceptions. I had to do some modifications to make it work for me. Now, no issues as such after I upgraded my laptop to 8 GB RAM and installed SSD drive with Windows 10 operating system.  Some cons -  1. After installing additional RAM only 5.5 GB RAM is user available - rest is utilized by integrated graphics.  2. Webcam is a disappointment. Just 0.31 Megapixels - poor resolution. It could have been better.  3. Touchpad and keyboard on a laptop seem vulnerable. Refrain from using it. Use an external keyboard and mouse if you would like to increase its life.  I took help from LaptoBoost to upgrade my laptop."
Lenovo-Laptop-Warranty-1-85Kg-82C6000LIH,laptop,"The best part of this laptop is balanced configuration in this price segment of 27k and Lenovo and amd reliable relationship. Moreover ryzen 3 is good compared to i3 and good boot speed. You need to install the windows yourself and better if vendor provide it but nevertheless the latest technical sounds feature will excites you. Lastly, sound is average which is one lag"
Lenovo-Laptop-Warranty-1-85Kg-82C6000LIH,laptop,Just so you know id doesn't have windows pre installed so you need to do it yourself . Im having that issues since i didn't see it in the discriptions
Lenovo-Laptop-Warranty-1-85Kg-82C6000LIH,laptop,Ok with this price range... Slightly slow. Design is good and very light weight.
Lenovo-Laptop-Warranty-1-85Kg-82C6000LIH,laptop,Definitely of worst product to purchase in Amazon portal. But I must say I have received great response from customer service Ms. Nidhi but the person who has come from courier is is very rude. Overall experience is miserable.

HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Best laptop for this price.But the laptop is little heavy about 2kg .It is absolutely very fast due to ssd .Also we can run heavy graphics game for medium performance. Also it is provided with additional slot for upgrading Ram upto 4gb. But the only disadvantage is for this money we can buy ASUS vivobook which is provided with more good internal parts . But for this price HP laptop is very valuable . Because HP has more brand value than ASUS .If you see this review as helpful pls press the button helpful. Thanks a lot for reading.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"Just got it a month ago..... Found some merits as well as faults..... The biggest merit being HDD+ SSD combo ..... while the biggest fault being ""the time which it takes to start working when switched on"""
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Super very nice product.... with all features in low price.  Win 10 boots up in 5 sec. Thats really fast which I was expecting.

Hope this work like this for a long time. Worth buying!!"
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Bought this product for 29990 with windows and ms office and it was working good. Within few days upgraded the laptop with m2 ssd and 8gb RAM and now its working very smooth and its very fast. My current configuration is 12GB RAM+ 250 Gb WD Blue SSD and 1 TB HDD. Upgraded to SSD as HDD is 5200 RPM and after upgrading laptop is very fast and system boot within 3-5 sec and there is no lag. If Your budget is under 30000 go for this laptop and you can upgrade RAM and SSD in future.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"1 TB HDD + 256 GB SSD (net storage about 1256 GB) along with a decent processor and 4gb ram, what else u want for office work and online learning !!Can't do heavy gaming coz it's just 4 GB ram , but it is fast thanks to the SDD provided. Build quality is decent , can't argue considering it's price. But definitely a budget + value for money laptop."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,It shows Microsoft office 2019 given with the prodúct but it is not true. I can't believe u are giving àmbigous details to sell a product

HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"I might return this and take a replacement or a refund, I will never go with HP .. On second thouht the lagging thingy might be because of OS Windows 10 (not sure)"
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Damn slow!!! Cant complain because at this price I think this is what you will get! But it is damn slow! Takes hell lot of time to start things and all this when absolutely nothing extra is installed.. I might need to add extra RAM! Screen quality is good though and it is light in weight but guys it's really slow!
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"I got this laptop for my kid's studies and it looked fit in the budget and had the right tools (MS office 2019: Word/Excel/PPT pre-installed free for life). It was delivered on time. The first boot up took 10+ mins, and I thought it was doing configuration and taking time. Post boot up, figured out that it had office 365 installed and not the office 2019, Student edition, which was mentioned available as part of the product. Called up Amazon customer care and I was redirected to HP customer care to talk on MS office related queries. I reached out to HP support and spent almost 2 hours with the technician, who promptly un installed the office 365 and installed the Office 2019 edition. The expectation was this should resolve the issue. But the product did not register itself. Now my query got escalated to Microsoft and am waiting on the product key to be sent to me. The HP support team was prompt and they in all respect tried to help me and to that I would like to give them the credit. May be I got a defective piece.. Coming to the laptop performance Takes 4 to 5 mins to boot Opened a Firefox browser and had 3 tabs open. The machine is getting stuck and non responsive. Could not even kill the instance. As per the advice, tried updating the drivers via auto update (Which I had turned off). Post some windows update, it started becoming even more slower and it takes time to identify the clicks also. Have raised the return request for this"
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"An excellent buy at 30k. All you need is an extra 8GB RAM (comes with 4GB installed) and a M.2 SSD which will make this run smoothly. I checked the ones which come with 8GB and SSD pre-installed but the pricing was much higher. My currently config after upgrade is 12GB+1TB(came with the original package) +500GB SSD. Pricing under 40K. Was lucky to get deals on the RAM and SSD as well.  So initially when checked without the upgrade the boot time was 2.53 mins. Post upgrading the RAM alone still boot time was around 2 mins. The magic happened post the SSD upgrade which is clocked between 25-30 secs from the time POWER button is pressed.  The system is running at quite good speeds and there is no lag at all in opening any applications. It comes preinstalled with Win 10 and MSO. It would also be good to see performance in gaming but since I am more into blogging and heavy picture editing I am finding this quite a wonderful addition to my kit while on the go.  The screen looks quite amazing especially since it has the glossy finish and the LED display looks all the more elegant in the high contrast background. The display brightness can be adjusted as per your liking. I would suggest you to add a screen protector to avoid any scratches on the screen when under day to day use. Also, a keyboard protector would be nice if you want to avoid any damage due to accidental spill of liquid and food.  Note: Unless and until you are not computer savvy please dont around prying to open the back cover. Remember your warranty becomes void once you do that and if you end up breaking anything in the process then you cant get it replaced as well. I wont be responsible for any damage that you do to your laptop in this process. If you are not sure of how to proceed either watch videos on youtube or get help from a professional."

Even if you bring egg 🥚 it may get hatch and if it's hen then that will also give an egg still that this laptop won't get started. It is slower than amoeba. hp deserve an award for making something very slow even one day scientists creat a spaceship which will move with the speed of light where time will get freeze but still it will have more speed that this 💻laptop
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"The system is extremely slow. And when you connect it to wifi it turns out to be thr slowest. The sound quality is quality is good but when it is turn to its maximum range, produces a weird noise. Toggline the screen is worst, it is so slow that you can only use one application at a time, that too keeps on hanging. And the worst of of all is the heating problem, it hardly takes 5 minutes to heat the system. You can literally feel the heat on the right side of the track pad. I feel it will explode someday.  I would suggest you to take better quality laptop than this. It's a complete waste of money. Even the botting process takes nearly 3 minutes. Once I had intelligence pentium, it was faster than this. Wish I had the return option, I would have done it long time back."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"It's very good laptop for our day to day life... Comes with very good configuration... Even I was confused before purchasing, but after receiving i have got full satisfaction... Happy with this laptop..."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Really hate this HP laptop and total waste of money. I got this laptop for my kid for online classes. It takes around 10 mins to start with this configuration and not even worth for just surfing internet. I wouldn't recommend this laptop to anyone and lost complete faith in HP brand
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"The laptop takes huge time (around 10 mins) to boot and post that the applications like MS word, MS excel, zoom etc takes minimum 5 minutes to open. Feels like I have been cheated out of my money. Plus there is only 7 days refund window for this seller. Not acceptable at all."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,I'm writing this just 10 days after buying this thing. Long story short. Don't buy this one. It's unspeakably slow. Hangs a lot and I don't have any memory intensive app. So disappointed.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"I spent 33000 rupees on this laptop for my son's education. I have always used desktop but because I wanted my son to get the flexibilty of studying from anywhere I paid this huge amout on this laptop. I never imagined a company like HP would do this. At first this laptop took around 1 hour for initial setup. I thoght becaise this is the first time is slow. Once the setuo was done I tried accessing youtube and it broke my heary. I spent so much money on this and it can't even play youtube videos. My son tried joing the call on Microsoft team and it crashed twice during the calla. It is a humble request to all, please think towice before buying! Oh and I foegot to mention about looks. My brother bought a laptpp 10 years ago and this laptop os an exact copy. Old style slow laptop."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,It's super slow for multi-tasking. Can't use more than 3-5 applications at the same time. My 5 year old desktop is more fast as compared to this with 4GB RAM and 2.3GHz athlon processor. Not recommended for professional use. Purchased it for my son's online class and it is serving the purpose.  I brought this laptop on 19/08/2021 and it shows warranty started on 22/06/2021 and is valid for 10 months. That is HP is offering 10 months warranty !!

HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"Product is good and reasonable under 30k. I have purchased it @32k. Which is lill more. Coz i have purchased intel i3 core @29k ehich is far better deal when compared to this one. Thin and light and comes with no optical disc. Battery backup is good. Last 7hrs to play videos. Though it has 41whr Battery. There are only 2 USB inputs which makes trou if going with Wired keyboard and Mouse.  For light work like excell, ms office work and similar its very good at this price range. Screen to body ratio is very good about 95%. Comest with genuine windows10."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"The Peoples Who got This model laptop are Luckiest according to me, This laptop is Awesome so it's not available anywhere, don't think More go for This, just see it's specification it's HDD + SSD and also with optical drive it's amazing. Screen quality is also good. Overall everything is Good Best laptop."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,HP laptop delivered to me is having an issue. Cooling fan is making unbearable noise. Customer care is not good. still chasing them. Let me provide update once my issue is resolved.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"Bought this for kids school. All that happens on this laptop is Google classroom. It doesn’t seem to ha for that also. Right out of the box it is slow to boot. After a week of usage, it is slower than the 12 year old laptop which was supposed to be replaced with this new one. If possible, I would have returned this product. Chrome books is much faster than this."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Laptop works well when you are not on video. It goes to dead state when my kid turn ON the video for his class. We ordered this initially thinking that my kid can attend his class without interruption. We requested for a replacement for this laptop which was delivered as expected. But all in vain. Issue is due to specific hardware/processor issue and we are still unable to find a solution.  Recommendation : Buy only if you are not using video and not too much load on the system.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"Day 1 review : The laptop seems to be pretty good from the means of basic usage, student usage, taking classes compared to the other laptops that I received earlier. The CPU usage is very low when using the browser which is very good for a 4gb ram and 2.6GHz laptop. The bootup procedure is fast. However it is not a very lightweight laptop as mentioned in the product description. A very good deal at such a price  Will keep posting after regular intervals :)"
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,This computer is very slow and keeps hanging. I want to return it but not able to reach the customer care since it is always busy. Very difficult to work since it hangs frequently.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Cannot believe on myself the mistake I made purchasing this laptop without going through the entire reviews. the laptop is damm too slow even without installing any additional software except MS office. for sure without an upgrade this is of no use to me.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"I didnt know that Ryzen processor might be so slow, when i start the laptop it takes nearly 5 minutes to start and stabilize. And this use is not even for some high gaming, Its for my sons school on Teams, so he has to be sitting 5 minutes early (good for him to be before time), but bad on part of HP to bring out such a lousy system at such a higher price, another 5K and i would have got a coreI5 system"
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,It's been a month and I'm still cursing myself for buying this. It takes good 5-7 minutes to boot. I struggled real hard to activate MS office and lastly after day to day pursuing HP they provided me serial key for the same. I should have returned this laptop but due to lethargic and extremely slow response from HP I missed the date. HP even remotely accessed my laptop and my issued didn't resolve. You guys will be surprised to know that this model is not even listed in HP store website. I would suggest you all to go for Dell or Asus.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Worse product never buy it.... Very very very slow proceesing and hang all time...

HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,NICE
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Very nice laptop for 35K. The features are very good for this price. Starts in 5s. Works fast and the storge is enough. The RAM can also be extended if you want but you will have to pay for it. Don't believe the image shown in Amazon the keyboard area of the laptop is also silver in colour due to which it looks very premium. If your budget is around 35k just go for it.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Pause... Take a breath... Think & Don't order First thing description is wrong THERE IS NO SSD ON THIS MACHINE just HDD with 5400RPM. This was biggest jaw drop for me. Secodnly description is wrong again it says FHD but resolution is 768.Chevk in specification. Ryzen 3 is good. I am now defragmenting drive to make it run faster. Can't return as mom has thrown away the box in which it got delivered to her. You know moms :(
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,One of the best laptops in this range of price. I had taken a month back. Performance is well. Battery life 5+ hours with continuous usage and it gets full charge within an hour. Another good thing is it's combination of 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD. But Microsoft office 2019 Student+Home version wasn't pre installed as they provided in the features. And there isn't any permanent anti-virus software too. We need to buy both later.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Delivery boy checked exchange laptop. It was working on main but battery was weak and could not support. I could have paid the exchange amount by cash but he just took away the new laptop in a very disrespectful manner and I decided to keep the order as cancelled. I hope the amount paid has been refunded to the card account. It was a poor service and I did not expect from Amazon.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,good product for students. it hangs little bit. it includes microsoft office and student which good. also have some gaming features for having fun for students not for professional. overall a good quality product for students or for someone purchasing laptop for first time. they can improve by expanding RAM TO 8GB then it will be the best product.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Do not get confused. This particular model does not come with ssd. Its 4gb ram with 1tb hdd. Painfully slow. Every action/click takes 1 to 2 minute to register. Startup takes a good 10 minutes. Go for it if you have no other option.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,HP laptops are always dead slow. I bought two laptops and are complete waste of money. It will even the i7 processor to hang..
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,The laptop has got a lot of issues primarily with its display. Nothing comes up on the screen. The customer care is also not supportive enough. It is a bad decision to purchase this laptop.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Do not buy this laptop.. after 1 month performance very bad. Battry working just for 1 hour. Seller sending used product
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,My HP Laptop screen flashes red green blue black on start up. I have seen tutorials where they tell me to boot my laptop through safe mode using F8 but nothing happens when i press it. Please Help!
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,I bought this laptop. It was good to use but after 1.5 year motherboard is dead. I have shown it in different shops but they are unable to repair it. I did the inquiry in hp service center and they said they will charge 20-25k for original motherboard with 1 month warranty.
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Like
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Slow speed Average laptop is this range Install SSD for better performance All over avarage mark for this laptop .
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,"Long lasting battery, screen quality is awesome. The low cost and the high quality of the product. HP has manage to make one of the best laptops for students under 35k."
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,The configuration of 256gb +1tb has been removed and the price has also increased. Don't know why but the previous product configuration was far better than this one

HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Heating issues and very average battery life

HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Awesome
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,Found it to be a great laptop in this price ☺️
HP-db1060au-Laptop-Ryzen3-Microsoft-Natural,laptop,The seller is showing 1tb hdd + 256gb SSD but he is sending only 1tb hdd so it's not working properly. Tooo slow
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).  Clarifications/issue points:  1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium. 2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop. 3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot. 4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit. 5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours) 6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious. 7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well. 8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.  Pros:  1. Configuration is best at this price level. 2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks. 3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast. 4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy. 5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews. 6. Display is average and gets the job done. 7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence. 8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB. 9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.  Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.  I’ll update this review after one month of usage."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box. Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop. Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right.. Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.  Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.  Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.  Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).  Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.  Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.  Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.  Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.  I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.  Update after 2 weeks: After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Don't buy this lap ... Don't be fool .  I spent around 70,000 for the lap, when I open laptop it's screen off and on happening automatically.  You can see the video above attached.  I request to replacement for the laptop, but not yet got any update.. already completed 15 days."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,It's too strange to see a brand new HP pavilion laptop got hung in the very second use. None of the keys working....can't even shut down......totally helpless....disappointment at its peak .....  The packaging too was no way near the required....  Frustration....disappointment....too bad experience.....
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout. Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.  Some closing thoughts: The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"As soon as the warranty period got over, laptop got defected .I complaind to hp care then it came to notice that amazone has not mentioned s.no in the bill for rectification of this error amazone took approx 18 days to correct the bill and for replacement of defective item Amazon is still making fool that your case is under escalation team and continuously giving new target date but not giving resolution. I am totally feeling mentally harrashed"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Laptop is good and Fast but the GHZ mentioned is not correct they say 4.2 ghz but what we receive is only 2.4 Ghz. I cannot put my earphone in this laptop since it is liitle bit small. earphone from jbl and working fine in mobile. overall laptop is good in this price range
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Nice product. USB type C can be used for charging but didn't work with 30W Oneplus 7T charger. May be work with 65 watt smartphone charger. Backlight Keyboard has only 2 dimming light settings. Apart from these everything is excellent.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"It is a good laptop in this price as compared to other brands. Fast booting. Applications open in a blink of eye. Only thing which HP has in its legacy is heating. It gets heated even with normal working. Screen, speakers everything is better when compared with the same price range laptops of other brands. Charging speed is okay, cannot say fast. Battery holds up for 5-6 hours for normal office work. All in all a good buy."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Nice
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Good
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I was searching for a laptop from Feb and bought this in Mar and am the first one to buy this from Amazon. The laptop has value for money, fast, long battery life etc. Sometimes it hangs for no reason. I believe it could be hardware issue and not related to Windows. When the laptop is kept on on a bed, the battery area heats up very quickly and hangs. There were no multiple drives. It would have been better if there were two drives ; one for OS and other for storing personal data.  One interesting factor I observed with Amazon is the moment I bought on march1, there was one review appeared with all 5 star though I have not rated the product. Amazon is giving fake ratings to many products like this. Unless there is a photo of video of the product I would recommend the users not to believe the review. Pros: Fast bootup More RAM SSD Long battery life Fast fingerprint reading Light weight  Cons: Hangs sometimes for no reason Less volume Key board layout is not user friendly No RJ45 Only one drive"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.  I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.  But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.  Advantage 1. Light Weight 2. Slim Body 3. Great Display & Camera 4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound 5. Output heat is place between screen  Disadvantage 1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet 2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key 3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply 4. There are 2 USB & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a 5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB A  Conclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Awesome features in this laptop Screen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ram Been using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"This laptop from HP has an excellent hardware configuration. A brand new laptop was delivered to me within 1 day of placing the order. The set-up was pretty fast. You can configure the Office 365 1-month trial version (comes with the laptop) or install your own MS-Office copy. Does not come with a carry-bag or any other accessory. Start-up is extremely smooth and fast with Windows Hello Fingerprint Scan and no problems encountered in the last more than 15 days of daily usage. The fingerprint scanner can however only be used for Windows Hello, it cannot be used for entering your password on websites using HP Security Manager App (as confirmed by HP Support Specialist). Other than this, no problems with the hardware configuration."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Quality of the laptop seems to be more premium and the lightweight of the laptop fits to our hand. I am not a gamer for normal usage it seems best in class. HP had worked very well in this series with good quality speakers and keyboards are nice power. On and off in lightening speed with the ssd but the only disadvantage is the internal webcam which makes me very disappointed . its just a hd camera. For this price range HP should work on the camera section. overall nice product.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,This is my first laptop and i love it !... It turn on within in fraction of seconds.. Pros : 1) 16 gigs of RAM & i 5 11 gen processor gives the butter smooth experience. 2) Excellent battery life  Cons: Touch pad should be more precise

HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,It’s look like renewed laptop because laptop charging jack is loose and left side speaker sounds like it’s tear. Bad sound quality and finger sensor quality look like 2011 touch phone of wing and any Chinese phone touch. Waste of money and one more thing day by day Amazon product quality getting poor
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Like: Booting time is very less. Light weight Super fast Finger touch unlock is super fast  Dislike: 180 hinges are missing Opening lid is not designed properly, bit difficult to open the lid"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Battery life is 7 to 8 hrs. Although if you use heavy apps like chrome, the battery life drains in 6 to 5 hrs. But if you game it drains in 4 hrs. I like the joint of the laptop it dosnt break easily. It has fingerprint, ssd makes it really smooth. Its very beautiful. Speaker is top class. Packaging was very nice,nicely delivered."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,I bought the HP laptop for personal use. Installation is super easy. Totally DIY. Windows 10 64bit + Office home edition is pre loaded. Speed is excellent due to 16GB RAM and it Processor. Display quality is superb. Very lightweight. I am very happy with my purchase.
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,Value for.money
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.  Bad experience after paying high price (around ₹67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.  Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive). Preloaded with Win10 Home and MS Office (not sure whether trial or full version). Drawbacks - weighs 1.42 kg, base gets warm rather quickly and so does the power adapter. Decent for a college student."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Cons: This laptop has rectangular display and if you were using MacBook 13, you might get surprised to see this screen feels smaller than that. So I suggest checking this out in physical store before buying.  I did not like the mouse trackpad as it’s not very responsive and sometimes gives wrong feedback.  Battery is decent, If not the best.  Pros: Thin, sleek, lightweight and handy. Windows package is good with free office. Laptop in general is quite fast"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"First, Notebook is Over Heating Second, Notebook is not opening I am fully unsatisfied"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Very good laptop, very light weight so can easily care and operate with single hand.  Battery life is okay as of now.  Brightness is also okay not so bright.  Sound disappointed as it’s not that great it’s hardly manageable at this price point.  Overall good laptop.  And yes, type-c port supports charging also so this is something cool 😊"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"So far, so good.  Things that could've improved: Screen quality and brightness Camera Keyboard tactile feedback Fingerprint reader"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"As of now, it's working fast and fingerprint scanner is also quick.  Windows 11 through insider program was downloaded by me and it is working flawlessly. It is surely an upgradable device, nothing to worry about. Wait for an official release of Windows 11 as insider program is a beta. If not, you can also upgrade it right now through windows insider program."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"There are things to like about the laptop, like 16GB RAM and a powerful processor. But I came across shortcomings that make it not so great buy if you are a software developer, artist or designer, a movie buff, or a power user. Reasons below:  1. The screen is anti glare which means muted colors. The viewing experience isn't great. A glossy screen can be converted to anti glare by applying film but not vice versa. So if you also intend to do a lot of content creation or watch movies and videos or for photo editing, this might not be a good purchase. 2. Non standard keyboard layout. There is an extra column of keys on the right, and that makes the typing experience unusual. You will get used to it over time, but that means you will no longer be productive on a standard layout and struggle with other computers. 3. USB Type C port is not of much use. Personally, my biggest issue with this laptop. You can't use it directly with a USB Type C Monitor. This is something my Rs 20k, 3 year old, Chromebook and Rs 240k MacBook, both, can do with ease. HP Support instead suggested that I buy a USB Type C to DisplayPort adapter and then run my monitor on DisplayPort instead of USB Type C. This isn't really a modern way of doing things, and I regret my purchase.  On top of it HP support isn't up to mark either. Their chat support is quite slow and simple requests might take hours of work. Email support creates a new thread and issue number with each reply. Moreover they send their replies in a couple of days, not promptly. They don't have an on site warranty for this, so you can't really ask them to come and see the issue.  All put together, a bad purchase for me. I will not recommend if you need a modern machine that would be perfect for your work, or value your time in general."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Bought this laptop and has started freezing suddenly. Usually happens when battery is low. Still thinking if I should return this or keep it. The packaging was good though when it arrived. Everything else is working smoothly but it has frozen twice now in the 1st week itself.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Before ordering the Laptop, I prayed to god to send me the perfect laptop without needing to contact the seller or the HP. and Yes, my prayed were answered. The Laptop works as expected - audio, camera, speed (as it has 16 GB RAM). Thanks HP and Amazon."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Pros: It is light weight, good graphics and configuration. Cons: But not worth of the cost. The touch pad is pathetic and very unconfortable to use. Battery life ok not great. Camera quality not good.  Over all this was my first HP buy!. Earlier I had Dell laptop and comparatuvely HP has very delicate and no fun Hardware. I regreting the deciaion to opt HP!!"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I got this laptop on 13th July 2021, laptop overall performance is good but when it's comes to battery it's discharge percentage is not showing properly. It's stucks at same percentage up-to 30 to 40 mins and then it's changing. Better not buying this product and I got replacement on this product ,Amazon service is very good. They responded very well and replaced the item.Now I'm just checking this new replaced laptop."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Writing review after a week of using my beautiful slim light weight laptop. No need to describe much as I found no cons in this laptop functioning nice no issues till now price might be a bit high but overall I found very nice and handy laptop for all students and study purpose and using software applications running smooth.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Worst experience. I bought this laptop from Appario retail, direct Amazon seller (not from the third party seller). This laptop worked fine for just two months. Facing display issues, the laptop screen is dark now with zero brightness. It works on the external monitor. Tried all sort of troubleshooting, all the drivers are up to date. Went thru all videos from official HP support site. Please dont buy this product or its variant by seeing 4+ rating."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Do not purchase any HP, unless you are very sure of. The touch pad makes noise while scrolling or using. Right click command keeps popping up without having clicked right....  Laptop Technical Team guys confirmed the issue... which is very common in HP.. according to one. Asking for Return"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,The system heats up a lot during normal usage or even when kept idle. Rest all seems ok as of now. Boots fast and good at multitask. Expected a privacy shutter for web cam at this price. Privacy concerned people pls buy one from amazon.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Boot time is less than 6 second
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Looks good. Decent product for this budget
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"An Amazing product from HP. Laptop was delivered today as promised by Amazon.  A 16GB RAM, Intel i5-11th Gen processor, with 512 GB SSD with IRIS integrated graphics , FHD display, backlit keyboard...what else we need in a laptop which costs less than 65k cost? Looks premium.  I searched all the ecommerce portals and even visited the stores, couldn't find a 16GB RAM laptop with in 65k budget.  5stars for HP pavilion 14 laptop and 5 stars for Amazon :)"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,I am satisfied with this purchase. The laptop comes with great configuration for personal and business use. As a plus point it looks cute as well. Overall satisfied with the purchase
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Amazing laptop. It justify the price tag. Writing this review after a month of use. Sound, display, connectivity, camera, battery backup, battery charging time, back light keyboard, speed is mind blowing. Finger print, alexa works absolutely fine. Design is superb, very much light weight. For office work, college-goers, this laptop is more than perfect. For gamers, I don't know, as I don't play computer games."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.  Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!  The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.  The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I’m still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP. Would have given negative 10 stars for Earth’s customer centric company if possible."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Had an issue with the product and the HP service support is horrible. I have called their support number about 10 times and written multiple emails. It’s been more than 10 days and nothing much has happened. Now the laptop is jst a piece of waste affecting my kids online school.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Battery life is around 6 hrs Brightness is ok and good about keylit function Light weight is true it's esay to carry everywhere Improvement requires heating is quickly so try to minimize it Esay to use but addition features requires because in same price another company gives additional benifit in that price so try to improve featured because it's costlier but not sense like not included featured and not giving leptop bag with leptop so company gives some bag to carry it Likewise good yet to be I'm not facing any issue and let's see how smoothly runs in foreseeable future and how's it's quality
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"laptops comes with good configuration for the price. boots up very fast . it is compact and light weight. missing privacy shutter for web cam. in outdoor it is difficult to use, as screen is dull even in max brightness. build quality is ok but does not give the confidence that it will last for long. keyboard and touchpad response is good. Battery lasts between 4 to 6 hrs based on usage."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Not as expected, I received a fault laptop and the model have cooling fan in the bottom it leads to overheat, I really loose the hope on Amazon on electronics item, I already bought a macbook air but it was working for 13 months now I received the HP pavilion laptop with fault,"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,The product batter charger arrived defected. There is not enough time to diagnose and react for a return or a replacement and amazon hides behind this fine print not to rpovide any customer support. HP doesnt help with the defect because it was bought from amazon. The worst effect is on us who paid BIG bucks for the below average product from HP and poor customer service from amazon.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I had given a good review earlier but 40 days later it is different story altogether. HP black screen problem is all pervading. I have installed no softwares nothing that could harm computer, but it is giving me ride for the day. No amount of customer response is helping. I have scheduled for on site visit. Let's see where it goes.  Switch to apple if you can afford."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"16 GB RAM + 512 SSD + 11th Gen processor + Quick charge + Backlit keyboard + Fingerprint = Total Value for money.  Pros: Superfast booting Compact laptop - bezels are thin, smartly moved speakers to bottom which saves a lot of space for the large keys. Crystal clear LED screen No heating issues (till now) Fast charging Backlit keyboard with 2 brightness settings  Cons (in general, none is a deal breaker for me) No LAN port only 2 USB (Type A) slots No scroll in touchpad"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Laptop is working fine so far. Great configuration and look. It fits my need of making my kid attend school and the technical hands I needed to do for my career. No major complaint so far. Battery life also seems good. Only small flaw which you can live with of course is the USB ports are little tight when putting headphones jack and while removing too. It should not be a cause of concern to not but this. Great product and if your budget allows, go for it."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"After 4 months of use I found, Sometimes MOUSE touch pad does not work properly. Otherwise everything is okay.  I have made changes in operating syste, windows 10 Pro has been updated over home edition.  Will recommend to all."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"The Laptop is fantastic at this price and I second to every 4-5 star rating given to this product  The only thing which I do not find comfortable is the touchpad making click noise while tapping on it Got a confirmation from HP, that it's by design and not a hardware issue, not sure if anybody else is finding this feature cool or not"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Please exchange the product immediately. The monitor screen is not switching on. This is the 2nd time I switched it on and its not working. I just purchased it on 2nd September 2021.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I am using it for two months, mainly for work from home and for browsing purpose. I have viewed movies also. finger reader is very fast. battery normal. 4-5 hours capacity. sound is loud though I prefer bluetooth speaker for watching movies on laptop. Overall it fulfills my expectations."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"HP would not consider dead pixel in warranty as they need 2 dead pixels. Above that if in case there is a dead pixel, then they will try their best to put up many reasons to not entertain it in warranty, calling it customer induced damage.. LOL.. Buy this at your own risk from Amazon. Who knows what i faced was because of Amazon induced damage during delivery... Someone tell HP that most common reason for a dead pixel is a MANUFACTURING DEFECT.."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Bettery gose to die quickly And 8% les laptop shut down u can't use les then 8% bettery remain
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"This product is very good for home use - for children's education and for home entertainment like watching movies and also for other normal computing purposes like web browsing, document management etc.  Also, having a 512 GB SSD drive, it boots up really fast.  Aesthetically, it looks very good - and hopefully durable too.  Overall, this hp product seems to be of great quality, although little expensive."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"A bad choice purchase from amazon. After a week of use, the laptop screen display goes off every 5 to 10 minutes. When it goes off, I need to switch the laptop on, the display comes back and after 5 minutes again goes off, again switch it on. Tired of it. Frustrated. Don't buy electronics from Amazon."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,The only thing that i dont like is the heating it produces under the laptop and sometimes it gets heated from top as well i.e area around keyboard.  Other then this i like this laptop. Battery life is around 4-5 hrs minimum if you are continuously working. Design is lit. Its thin and looks cool!
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The laptop I received was having RAM issues which could only be diagnosed after 7 days. And so I have to incur the repair cost .Hence I would advise not to buy anything electronic from Amazon. For every thing else Amazon is just good.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Nice product in this price range
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Performance is really fast Battery lasts 6 to 7 hours Display quality excellent I just loved backlit keyboard Light weight Premium look Blindly go for it
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Battery life is very good, touch pad is very responsive, keyboard has 2 settings for backlit lighting. Ports are a little tough in the beginning. Great buy 👌"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Loved the size and lightweight of laptop. It surely gives premium feel. 512 SSD and 16 gb ram..boosts multitasking..did not face any issue yet. Only thing is don't buy this laptop for gaming as the keyboard keys looks delicate.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Incredible performance and refined design make this a winner. A brilliant screen and classic design meets a high price. Till now working satisfactorily.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Every thing is good but build quality with that muc price tag..it's really bad. I will suggest don't buy it because when you are going to pick this laptop you will just feel the bad Material used. Never seen such build quality even in lower prices laptop. I can't return other wise definitely I would have returned due to only one reason i.e. built quality.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I brought the laptop recently and disappointed with the overall performance, the Wi-Fi takes lot of time to connect and some times it just disappears. Keyboard look is pathetic, double click is very hard to press and its not user friendly."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"I purchased this laptop since three months ago, after using this laptop for more than 3 months i am writing this review. mind blowing laptop, performance and speed excellent. overall performance of this laptop is very good, recommnend for purchase."

I want the laptop to be either replaced or would like to return it for refund please."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I had seen the specifications and bought this laptop upon checking details this laptop is not 4.2ghz it is only 2.42 ghz. The battery does not last more than 2 hours

HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Pavillions are the worst laptops please think twice before buying this product I have Pavillion laptop i5 but the performance is really not to the point plus i have graphics card and its not up to point as it seems to be better buy a asus laptop
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,I bought this laptop from hp store. This is the best budget laptop having 16gb - 3200 RAM. We can also increase the capacity of SSD to 1TB. One thing I didn't like is 250 nits brightness..mit should have been 300 nits.  - latest 11th gen processor - 16gb RAM - SSD storage - Backlit keyboard - Fingerprint - Type C charging (but they don't provide type C Charger) - Only 1.41 kg
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"The only notebook brand in the market offering the latest specs for under 90k. I bought the Core i5 + 512 GB SSD model in April 2021 for about 61k from a recognised HP showroom instead of Amazon. After one and a half months of usage, I can say it's one of the good ones.  Although the webcam this model has is the worst. It is not 720p HD, it's worse than a low-level VGA webcam. The video and photos are extremely grainy and tinted. I approached HP Care thinking there was an issue with this unit. Turns out it's a universal problem and they wouldn't change the unit because the hardware was fine.  Sound is pretty good, finish looks premium metal, but is plastic... hopefully durable. It's on the quiet side with respect to fans, which only make noise if you're processing something heavy like updating the BIOS or converting a rather heavy raw video file to MP4. The chiclet keyboard is good, not too creaky and the backlight feature has a dimmer setting too.  There's a handy-dandy fingerprint scanner, which is smooth and fast with tactile recognition. The display is reasonably good, but not so powerful outside. If you work outdoors a lot, you'd have to put it on full brightness. You probably won't get optimum results even then.  A little disappointed in HP Care and the declining webcam quality. Given this day and age, there is a need for at least standard quality webcams. However, considering the price and the specs, the notebook is still worth it.  Pros: - Latest Core i5 processor - 16 GB DDR4 Dual Channel RAM - Lightweight and smooth design - Reasonably good display - Backlit keyboard - Decent battery life ( I got 5-6 hours of heavy use on battery, but that might be different based on what applications you're using) - Good audio - Intel Iris Xe graphics are really good. You don't need an extra graphic card unless you're into hardcore video editing, 3D modelling or design or heavy gaming. - Expandable SSD storage - Fingerprint reader  Cons: - Terrible webcam quality - Metallic finish, plastic build - Screen hinges aren't the most flexible - Number of ports - 2 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB Type C, 1 MicroSD reader slot (as opposed to a full or mini SD slot, which makes it a bit difficult for DSLR users) - Only 512 GB of SSD storage - Colour - only Natural Silver, surface prone to scratches.  Will update if I notice anything else. Hope this helps!"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Great laptop! I am impressed with the FHD display and colour reproduction. Super fast for regular users. Light weight and compact. Speaker are also good and loud enough.  I purchased it for my daughter's online classes and it does the job well.  Browsing and video watching is super smooth.  THE ONLY CON HP claims that battery lasts upto 8 hours, practically it lasts for 3 hours with continue didi and video calls on Microsoft teams. Confirmed this with HP support. But this not a big deal for me as this is a home laptop and I can always connect the charger.  My overall feedback: if you are looking for a fast compact and lightweight laptop, which has great display and sound, go for this one."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,This could easily be the worse laptop at this price point as quality of the product isn't anywhere close to satisfactory....i don't knw if others have noticed it but the screen panel itself isn't installed properly into the panel housing....it could be misalignment or unsymmetric spacing between the left and right sides of the screen panel and top n bottom also.....even all the entry level laptops that i have come across have properly installed panels.....so please check carefully with the screen panel ...its not perfectly postioned......overall a really bad experience with HP ......
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Hp has done a great Job with their newly launched pavilion series. This model has all the latest features and it's very quick too. Best laptop at this price point. Don't think twice, Just buy it. You won't regret it 👍🏻"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"No matter how promising HP laptops look, their build quality is poor and have a track record of shipping faulty laptops and misfit chargers - speaking from experience with a top of the line 2L HP Envy laptop.  If the laptop is dead on arrival, they have a pretty lengthy process to get a certificate and their services, especially in Mumbai, India are pretty poor.  Save your hard earned money, if you want a reliable laptop, would highly recommend Asus."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"The product specifications are appearing worth while working with the laptop. Nice product by HP. Excellent performance, classic graphics, sound quality- a real Dolby sound much exhilarating, backlit keyboard, good battery backup upto 7-8 hrs. Slim n light weight product with elegant look. The biggest thing is its startup and log off time which hardly takes 5 to 3 secs respectively.  Pros: Nice laptop ... highly commendable. Cons: Not yet noticed after its 3 days purchase."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,I dont want to talk about the specs and other technical stuff - since you can compare that and see for yourself. Overall - its a great laptop with 16 gb ram and at this price point - its perfect for home business and personal use.  Probably cant use it for A grade gaming or heavy image editing or very heavy data processing / data science  Whats great: 1. Trackpad 2. Keyboard 3. Fast boot 4. Great look and feel 5. small and light  Whats not so great: 1. The screen cant swivel/fold beyond a few degrees 2. the cover is a dust magnet 3. the keyboard couldve been slightly better
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Amazing machine for Web and Android App Development. I am using this laptop with Ubuntu and it's performance is Amazing.
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Laptop-15s-fq2071TU,laptop,"I was surprised when I got the product, the laptop is sleek however the build quality is very substandard. The keyboard keys and the plastic used is of very low quality. Not happy after paying 55k for this."

HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Got the HP pavilion 14 three weeks ago. Was really excited as I was using a HP probook 430 G2, which had 4gb DDR3 RAM, i5 3rd gen and around 1tb HDD. So I think you guys have a clear image of how excited I was when I got the Pavilion with 16gb DDR4 RAM, i5 11th gen and intel iris XE. Let me give you a clear image of my purpose of this laptop. I am buying this laptop solely for the purpose of college, so for downloading all the softwares required in the mechanical engineering field, softwares required for assignments(power point, office, word), softwares for communicating(whatsapp, telegram, mail) and entertainment platforms(netflix, prime, spotify) and other programs as potplayer, qbit and a bit of tweaking. The battery life on this ultrabook is really good( I can't really say the best even though I want to because I haven't really had the opportunity to explore the battery life of this laptop's direct competitors). It easily lasts upto 4.5-5 hours when I set the battery option to best performance). Its built quality dazzled me as it was really sturdy than it appeared. No loose hinges or anything. The screen stays where we set it, and no wobble while typing which shows the rubber grips are placed parallel to the surface. The display is bit less brighter than I anticipated, I would give it a 9/10. The typing experience is really good on this keyboard, however the color for the keyboard was a bit of a bad choice. I am a OCD type of person, So I get a bit irritated when I find smudges on the trackpad, keyboard, or on the inner surface of the laptop, but I doubt you guys will even notice it. The sound quality is really good on the laptop. This weighs around 1.4 kg so this laptop is easily portable, without compromising on performance, battery life and display (atleast for me)."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,"Overall good laptop, with good specs,,there aren't somany issues with the laptop,, good display, sound quality is good, fast enough for any work, light weight, low fan noise, good viewing angles, best booting up and shutting down time, charges fastly ,etc... The only problem I faced is with the battery,,, it charges quickly but lasts 4 to 5 hours,at continuous usage, if we are not using continuously as ho claims it last more than 9 hours, other than tht i haven't faced any issues, - i bought ceramic white colour(dv0053tu) and it looks fantastic and premium than the silver one."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Graphics-14-dv0055TU,laptop,Battery life is not upto the 2021 standards and it is only last for 4 hours on normal usage Rest every thing is great and the body is plastic not aluminium. The laptop is light weight and great performance.

Load heavy applications like autocad, revit , 3dsmax quickly (takes only 10 or 11 seconds). Great performance and quick response. I got 8GB 3200mhz ram .I suggest to upgrade ram to 16GB for better performance. Very thin and light weight laptop. Iris Xe graphics works perfectly.  Cons: keyboard backlight is not available Sound quality is good Display is good ( use an external display for getting better colour reproduction). Camera quality is average Position of heat vent is right below the display . Better use a laptop cooling fan while using heavy programs."

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"1. Display -10 2. Sound - 9 3. Trackpad - 8 4. Battery backup - 9 (initial impressions regarding battery is good) 5. Looks - 10 6. Webcam - 7 ( awkward position ) 7. Build - 8 ( I don't feel it is that bad good quality plastic is used ( at least it feels so) need to check in the long run. 8. Multitasking - 7 ( considering the price bracket it comes in it is justifiable. 9. Heating issue - not faced till now but without fan it would be difficult to control the temperature. 10. Value for money - 9  Overall considering the price of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.  Who should consider this laptop ? Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etc  Anyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Recieved today. 1. First impression is good. Does the job for the Price. Don't expect much from this by spending 13.5 k money. Expecting gaming and editing etc. from this low priced entry level machine is a foolish thing. Expect, upto what u spent on the product.(only disappointing factor who actually disappointed by their purchase) 2. MS office is trail version only lasts for one week after setting it up. 3. But, I don't know the reliability of this machine. 4.I think it can be used for adequate period of time, if we handle it smoothly and carefully. 5. Best under budget laptop with good built quality, sound and display 6. A good replacement for tablet. Used for online classes for kids and documentation works and entertainment purposes...."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"On 6 day its display automatically got off. we request for replace the delevery boy came & didnt took our laptop. He told that its display is not working we cannot take , Display is not working thats why we are replacing, otherwise we would have use it . So he told to apply for refund so we did it but same reason they were giving. We have request more than than 10 times for refund. The customer care guys says that it will be refund but noone comes to take it. Customer Care of AMAZON is up to the level of worst. Its been a month the laptop is with me with no working condition.

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"This laptop is designed for following basic task- 1-Office work(MS word, excel, PowerPoint etc) 2- Basic net surfing (Fb, Youtube, Online form filling etc) 3-Watching movie 4- Good battery  Believe me this laptop handles all above mentioned tasks like a boss in a speedy way. All of this due to 128GB m.2 ssd installed in it.  Pros- 1- IPS Display 9/10 2- SSD 9/10 3- 4-5hr battery backup 7/10 4- Design 8/10 5- Build quality 7/10  Cons- 1- 3.5hr of Charging time 2- Charger Quality 3- Sometimes mouse trackpad & keys are a bit unresponsive.  Verdict- This laptop @13.5-15k price is 100% value for money. Although this laptop equipped with celeron processor but believe me it does what it is meant for. You can't expect a scooter to carry the loads of a Truck. Same goes here. This laptop is made for basic tasks and it does flawlessly. Hence it is a perfect budget choice for students, online classes, office works etc.  If you are in Gaming & video editing work..then please don't buy this laptop. This laptop is not made for such tasks. Thanks."

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"So, I ordered this after reading the reviews of my predecessors. I can say I was not at all disappointed. I got this machine today and I am writing the review from this. Well, as I started to setup this up, I realized that it was too slow. I gave it the benefit of doubt and shut it down for later use. when I setup it up, the battery was around 70%. At the end of the setup it as 60. Fine, I give it an hour and resume exploring it. I set the mode to battery saver and cleansed all the unnecessary apps, and downloaded chrome and acrobat. I want to use this laptop for light browsing, creating word documents, reading pdfs and watching movies in spare time. Thus far, it has now disappointed. The display is amazing and one can feel the SSD in action- crisp and sharp. I have used macbook air and this doesnt disappoint. Also, the design is very catchy, inspired from Macbook and Yoga 360. The price was also decent. Well, I started a 60% battery, remember- it is 34 now. The battery sis the only concern I see. but otherwise this is awesome. Zyada ungli mat karo- chup chap laptop kholo, normal use karo rakhdo. Zyada kalakari karne ki avashyakta nahi hai. If you expect that you can hack Iran's nuclear plant with this , then All the Best. Do not use it for heavy coding and games. Also the frame is decent ,not aluminum but plastic but I find it sturdy and ultra light. I will update this as I move with this machine."

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"The product was super awsome but what I got was a defective one, which had a dead pixel on the same. As the replacement was not available what I got was refund. But Would reorder the same for sure. The issue was with the display that it had a dead pixel in the center of the screen  Have used for a 2 hours only for diagnosing and all. But performed in its best way with all the specs it had such as the speed for instalation and the scrolls and all were super awsome  For Dispaly its crystal clear that its a 14"" inch display powered by IPS and Full HD. I hope you can understand the depth of view it provides.  Will Definitly recomened to anyone. Have reordered the same. Waiting for the product to receive."

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Review after using for 4 days.  Pro's - 1) Performance - It can easily handle basic tasks such as browsing, MS office, watching movies & online class. 2) Storge - Even though we juz get 128gb ssd storage(out of which 94gb is available to use), we can expand Storage using memory card slot. One thing i liked in this laptop is we can easily insert memory card without card reader juz like we do in mobile phone. I brought 128gb sd card & inserted in it. I am storing all my files in the sd card. Don't store any files in system storge (128gb ssd slot). It will slowdown the Performance of system. 3) Display & Sound - Top class 👍 4) 🔋- Okayish  Cons - 1) Charger pin is very loose. I m worried about its durability 2) Hinge - I am really worried about hinge. It's very loose. Hope it won't fall down. Avita should focus on this 4) Keyboard & mouse pad are hard. 3) Build quality - Actually i don't say this as con for the price i paid(13600rs). I am satisfied with plastic built quality for this price. We need to be careful & make sure that laptop won't fall down from height.  Finally if you are looking for basic laptop for online classes, Watching movies, MS office, browsing & if you can handle laptop carefully. Then go for it."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Heating issue. Memory issue. Received uses old stock item with lot of dust and scratch. I lost my money in buying this waste product
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Recent review- (earlier review can be found after recent) Since past couple or weeks I had observed mouse touch-pad issue. The movement of mouse is not as expected, it’s slow. I made all possible changes in settings but no use. It’s a bugger when I use MSPaint tool. While working in mspaint the mouse pointer suddenly jumps anywhere on the screen.(Attached video) I had registered complaint to Avita customer care about this and they attended in 2 days and the technician replaced entire touch pad along with keyboard. But still the problem was not resolved.  I have again registered the complaint and will see what they do about it. Will keep you updated..... ——————————- Below was the review I posted in first 4 days- ——————————- A suggestion to laptop buyers is that before purchasing it, know what your own requirement is. I purchased this laptop for my son’s school activities like Online classes, video conferencing etc. Basic activities like MS Teams, MS Office, Browsing etc. can be done without any problems. As it comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, you have an option to disable it but I preferred not to, because its Secured mode and it helps to keep laptop safe from any Malware and saving you additional Antivirus cost. This laptop gives me battery backup of AT LEAST 4hrs with uninterrupted online class. Standby time would be definitely beyond that. Build quality is good according to its price. It costed me around 17k. I searched Amazon, Flipkart for budget laptops and this was the only one that deemed fit in my requirements. SSD really makes difference than conventional HDD. Its super fast, loads windows in seconds(depending on config). All ports are working fine. Please Note- This laptop DOES NOT have a Lan Port as it supports Bluetooth and Wifi only. As most of us are working on Wifi only, Lan port should not be an issue. Overall- I am satisfied with the laptop. I may change my review after couple of month’s usage if I see any difference in performance."

Even 10 different browsing windows works fine. More than that slows down the Laptop. Not much heating initially but after 2-3 hours of continuous usage bottom gets heated. Very thin and lightweight and medium sturdy, so not for heavy rough and tough usage. Keyboard is good. Touchpad position is awkward and size big, so people with bigger palms will accidently touch mouse touchpad when typing.  Overall after a month of usage, found not much issues for general usage of browsing/meetings/videos watching. Not tried any games and any external apps as Windows is in S mode. But with browser all apps usable, like spreadsheet, document editing, youtube, etc."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Only for very basic purpose of 90's. Dont expect much from laptop but laptop expects user to have lots of patience even for basic operation.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I didn't checked before buying that it comes with window s mode, s mode is not allowing any other web browser to install. but there is option which showing purchase other browser.  Laptop is very slow, wrost working experience. although i purchased it only for internet surfing but it is useless for me because its not allowing other web browser than microsoft edge.  Also in it having window 10, three days i have used, window 10 is auto consuming my internet in internal updates, and 2 gb internet consumed in less than 10 minutes, what a rubbing product how i can use internet in this system.  I try to uninstall window 10 and install 8.1 or lower version but it not allowing to install other windows version too.  finally when i use microsoft edge browser with broadband so that i have unlimited internet, but when you open multi tab it always goes slow or hang or other pages stop working . what a rubbish product it is. my fault is i didn't used it within 7 days of purchase, i thought it is looking good from body, it should be good, but believe me it is horrible, I wish to give it 0 star. now i want to return it to seller, i am not getting how to do.  complete money waste!!!!"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Build is OK for better other other avita model I m not expecting this good Everything 5in display very good Keyboard connectivity battery back up also good  But I return this laptop due to speakers not working and also no fan in this model temperature always 60 to 75 degree  Not good for game not even high quality video playback. Only good office 360 and browse low quality video playback Utube netflix etc
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"The description is incorrect. Reported 3 times to amazon it's been 3 Month ut they did not change. 1. It is a completely plastic body, not Aluminium 2. No Backlit keyboard 3. Mentioned Country of origin as Hong Kong but it is China.

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Bought it for online classes and the worst thing is the camera is not working. Tried contacting the customer care through mail,phone, WhatsApp, Facebook and LinkedIn but no response whatsoever. Tried troubleshooting myself and found that there's no driver for the camera and the worst of them all is you can't even find the camera driver in their webpage itself. PATHETIC BRAND.. PATHETIC SERIVR.. PLS DON'T BUY THIS EVER..!!"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Very good laptop for 15000 I bought it for 5700 under exchange. For browsing and simple official work only and email check best laptop the screen resolution 1240x1920 good one for you tube and movies
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Bad choice, screen is not effective, hangs , machinery and system over all is ineffective, keys don't press properly  I am bound to keep this since Amazon refused to take return or do replacement, all that money on this laptop is a waste now as this laptop is a show piece  Not at all recommended  This feedback is a comparative feedback from other machines I have"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Battery backup is really osm and display is fabulous...iam facing heating issue during YouTube at 4k And build quality is not superb ,only okay product The main quality of the laptop is storage Very suitable for lite document works and watching photos and mvies"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Bingo!!!! The product is awful as battery gets drain quickly and Kudos to Amazon and Seller for brining pocket friendly product at this tight budget situations.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"If you ever plan on using Microsoft Excel, stay away from this laptop and brand. Doesn't have the ability to lock Fn (function) key nor is there any option to do so in the BIOS.  The manufacturer is helpless in software support and customer support only says sorry, they can't do anything about it.  It's a pain since the keyboard isn't even good quality and it's a pain to press Fn key each time you need to press F2. Horrible product and I'd not recommend this brand to any Excel user, AutoCAD user or any person who needs to using Function keys regularly."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"i just gotta fan of the display. Display is just awesome. Looking is too good , light wieght. Not for high processes. Very good for productive use. Like browsing , entertainment and basic applications will run smooth. SSD inbuilt, too responsible. More than i expected.  Only thing is speakers are too bad, and little build quality is compromised. Rest, Worth more than money."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Its an good looking laptop , which does its job. Initially when i got the package had its warranty seal open and the trackpad stopped working another day got replacement other day and that unit also had issue ( top hinch plastic was coming out while opening the lid) so i decided to put a drop of quick fix . Than another day the windows suddenly showed blue screen and had to fix the same with BIOS boot order change. I cancelled the return of the unit as its working fine now after windows reset . This laptop is good but i have serious doubts that if the quality checks are done or not after manufacturing ."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"1-Excellent display and viewing angle, less bezels, can play 4k videos on YouTube without lag 2-Sound quality is decent 3-Battery backup Normal 3 hrs plus 4-Built quality is also good as per the price 5-Software performance is more than enough with ssd faster boot 6-Very light product 👌 Overall very good product at this price range, i got it in 13.5k, less than an average mobile price."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I was very apprehensive of buying this computer but I did not have the budget to go for i3 or i5 so I bought this. Oh man ! this is one heck of a laptop. You will be delighted to lay your hands on this laptop. The screen is top quality, similar in quality to that found on many top-end models. It is not shiney but matte which you can use for long periods of time without problem. The keyboard is decent and comfortable. The touchpad may have been better, it does not have the finesse of higher end models. The body is made of plastic but looks stunningly good. Hope it does not start showing signs of wear for some time. The size of the laptop is just perfect, light-weight and very comfortable to work on. Speakers are ok, acceptable at this price point, sound is loud enough. It has a front camera which is Ok in quality but it is placed in a very odd position (near the screen and keyboard joint) which makes it not suitable for most face to face chats. The speed of the laptop is very good. It boots in 10 s and shuts down in the same time. All applications such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Office run smoothly. It does not show any lag even when I open a lot of programs together. Battery life is decent, about 3-4 hours on a single charge. All ports are located on the back side, not on the sides as in other laptops but this is not much of inconvenience and I am hardly inconvenienced because of this. The nest this about this laptop is the top quality screen. The worst thing is the placement of camera and probably a little less than perfect track pad (but not too bad)."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Since I have ps4 console, I bought this laptop only for office work, browsing and watching online stream videos.. If u need for basic use, go for it. This is not a gaming laptop.. I had Asus laptop previously and it sucks in performance and cost around 25k however i bought this laptop as exchange for 9k and the speed is awesome. Battery backup comes around 3hrs 30min if we watch videos. Normal use comes around 5hrs. Its very slim one weighing around 1.3kg only. Easy to carry not like my old asus(heavy one) and my office dell laptop(weighing around 2kg) Overall a good budget laptop Worth 9k for basic level. I will again update you guys after three month use."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"The laptop is too good, have been using it since 2 months now and no issues at all… battery needs recharge soon but amazingly smooth for basic work. Got it at super price of 19000 only what else you can get! I am very happy. Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery also  The integrated camera is a big issue - the position of camera is just not good. If u look at camera then u cant see screen and vice a versa - for online school also children may face issue of battery and camera position"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Below are my verdicts compared to the price I bought it (₹17,150) # Well built, nice looking, slim and light weight # Windows 10 built in, though in S mode, but S mode can be disabled with latest Windows updates # Decent performance for few light weight multi tasking, such as web surfing, playing songs via media player, documents editing, connecting to remote desktops. Dont expect any gaming performance from this humble device. # Keypad is nice, no backlit though # 2 USB ports, 1 HDMI # Screen display is really nice, nice resolution # Battery back up is fine. Depending on usage. I am getting in between 5 hours to 7 hours for very light weight use with battery saving mode enabled. # Camera quality is not upto the mark, could have been better # Mouse trackpad is nice, wide, intuitive # 4 Gig RAM serves the purpose # 120 GB SSD delivers good performance # Bottleneck is created by 2 vCPU Intel Celeron processors. But overall manages to deliver basic performance, CPU clocks upto 2.5 GHz when demand is High. L1 and L2 cache are on lower side, no L3 cache. # Speaker is loud enough, lacks the fineness / Quality, but does the job, you can watch YouTube, Movies, listen to songs..  Overall, a nice well built laptop at this price with decent performance for basic activities, don't load it up with too many apps running in parallel, it will serve you well.  Also, wait for offer price. It is a value for money product when bought at price around 17K, Not at its normal price which 19K"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Within 4 days of use, the right hand side of the screen turned blank, see attached photo. This is a sub standard product that is being attempted to be sold on Amazon and will tarnish your reputation. I need this to be returned and my payment refunded."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I didn't expect such a fabulous product for such a low price. Its a fully functional laptop with all basic features, looks elegant & Cute. faster booting time, nice keys, super display. Speakers are bit inferior, but still good for the value. The batter charge stands well and charging is fairly quick. This is the first day impression. Well and safely packed. Didi the online registration for the warranty using the serial no on the back of the laptop."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Decent as it is mentioned, not meant for gaming at all, suitable for office work and media consumption.. Had to use external mouse since mouse touch pad is very irritating.. In conclusion it's an extremely basic laptop."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Writing this review after 10 days of delivery of the laptop  - Yes it is the best cheapest laptop - I did buy the laptop @17K - No heating issue till now(as laptop is new) - Battery works for straight 5 hours(pretty good till now) - speakers are loud and awesome - SSD is a great add on to speed as the laptop contain ceremon processor. - Screen quality and camera quality is too good.  About S mode - I removed the S mode on the very first day as I need to install local softwares - I did install billing software(GST) which works smoothly - I did install printer drivers, zoom meeting software. - Till now laptops is very fast and smooth (Don't install heavy softwares)"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Bought an Avita laptop and its battery started showing some charging issue on the SECOND Day of receiving the item. Reported the issue with Amazon as well as Avita. Avita technician examined the laptop and with an OS reset it appeared to be working. It started showing issue after a few weeks and again the technician came and confirmed that it is a battery issue. After a few weeks they came and replaced the battery. It worked for a very few days and again started showing issues.  This time the technician found issues with Motherboard and order for a replacement motherboard. After waiting for a few weeks the technician came to replace the MB. Interestingly it is noticed that the MB was not compatible with my laptop..It is different design and not suited for my laptop. He took it back and I am still waiting for my MB replacement.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Now it has 3month over & I'm writing this.... I use this for a basic use only just like wfh works, excel, word, browsing etc. Believe me you are gonna love this afterall in this price range you can't find a better deal anywhere but at first you have to search is there any service centre available nearby your area or not, If yes then you can buy this without any hesitation. 1. Battery backup - upto 6hours till now 2. Screen ratio - you gonna love it 3. Keyboard & Touch pad - its good but better you must buy a mouse and a keyboard 4. Look and design - awesome  Negetive remarks :- camera quality is ok at this price but not in right place.....if u have to attend a lot of online class or meeting then think before buying it."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Bought for my wife to work on google sheet. Simply awesome to work on small software. Please do not expect wonders out of it. Display is absolutely stunning. Full hd . Anti glare. soothing to eye. Good quality plastic. I was sceptical with celeron as long bak i had experience with old celeron version which was damn slow. But good improvement in this one . No lag watsoever. Keypad is crisp and gives nice feedback. Booting takes 10 to 13 secs. Recommended.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I have bought AVITA on 02 May'21. It's close to three months that we are using it for my Kid's (4th grade) online classes. Display size, screen resolution and sound are great. The minor drawback I feel is about the camera's location. Probably to support the enough screen size, it might be placed just above the keyboard and bottom of the screen."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,This laptop is budget king Keep in mind this laptop is not made for gaming so 😕 no gaming  King for daily work and online class 💪 Don't use it hardly because material is no do good  Battery backup is too good  Screen quality is high and FHD so no issues there  Keyboard is also good 👌  Compact size 😉  Thanks for reading my review 😊  Go for it
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Laptop performance under satisfactory. Lags very much. Can't even use YouTube smoothly. I returned it but the service by Amazon was even worse. Waited for 3 weeks to get my refund!! Will suggest everyone not to buy this product.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Light weight, stylish laptop good for basic office or house use, my daughter is happy to do her online classes and basic of coding. But one major issue is even though on the selling page it's written windows 365. And the buyer will assume that it's already installed like any other laptop, but this doesn't come with windows. And then one has to pay additional 5k per year. In that case it's total price will come closer to other branded laptop. One more thing which put me down is about there call center. If you have any issues or enquiries try to call God to help because the chances of getting a reply from God is more likely than Avita call center."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Cute and Lovely I bought this mainly for its SSD hard disc Highest resolution which you can't get from anyother laptop of this price and this screen size It's a great idea that they've provided all the USB port, charge port, audio port behind the laptop. Works excellently with my favorite ubuntu OS( I removed windows) I don't use laptops for gaming"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"At this price the product is a bargain. I bought it for my wife for simple office work in Word Excel, surfing net, viewing videos et al. Booting is fast and screen quality is good. It came with a jacket and a hard paper board cover for safe keeping after work. She has been using the product for over a month without any issue. She didn't go for game or anything that require using camera."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,I don't like this laptop. This is worse. Automatic mouse pad working without touching. Automatic right click working and search button automatic pressing Because of this error I can't tolerate. Don't Buy this laptop. This laptop is malfunctioning. Don't buy... This laptop..
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I was sceptical about the celeron processor but was pleasantly surprised to see the clock speed it can maintain (around 2.6 GHz) without a fan! SSD makes the performance even better, arguably the best in the price segment. Added plus is windows 10 home bundled! Display brightness is average but quality is good and bezels are thin. Webcam position is awkward and makes you look like you're rolling your eyes as you look at the screen during a video call. Build quality is questionable, but there are bound to be tradeoffs."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,This is a perfect laptop for every day use. Light weight and performance adequate. Though with celeron processor it works really well. You can easily get out of S mode and do installation of your like. Prints very well and moreover it comes with 24 months on site warranty. It's a must buy for people with lower budget.  Let's see how it evolves in coming months.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Today it's exactly 1 month since I am using the laptop. So far it has been functioning well, except that it tends to heat up quickly. Also, there is no RJ45 port on it which was an issue for me as I mostly connect through wired Ethernet network. I solved it by buying an USB Network Adapter those are easily available. Other than that everything is working ok so far. It's a nice entry level laptop in this price."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Product z very Good..but...service vry worst in my area.....boy reckles answer.... irresponsible person
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"It is an ideal choice for any user who wish to use this Laptop for education, internet browsing, office applications such word/excel/powerpoint/pdf editing, certain level of gaming etc.  Top brands such as dell/lenovo/hp are good but AVITA brand is giving tough competition to them at the price with performance and quality.  I bought this for my kid to study online school, internet browsing, documents editing and used for online and offline gaming as well.  It has lowest storage size but for aforesaid utilisation it is more than enough and now a days you have good amount of storage online available using one drive, google drive etc at no extra cost.  Spending Rs.18,990/- for this laptop is worth and more value for money.  I am from technical background so choosing right product is by-default nature of my competence so after searching for many products available in store and online, I finally put my bet on this device to take risk at low price and this has proved me correct. (Otherwise I would have spend atleast 40k+ to buy a laptop for kid if I had look for any top brands.)"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Not suitable.. infact it doesnt match the product descriptions.. return policy is also not there.. totally waste of money. Webcam is placed on the keyboard so it is not usable at all. Dont buy!
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I ordered it on 15th May 2021 and recieved on 18th of May. This is my first laptop and I've not used it too much. I use it for browsing, microsoft office etc. Main cons with this laptop is heating issue. It starts heating too much just on switching on. Second issue is battery % fluctuats automatically, I think it's not optimised properly. Btw if it doesn't have heating issue then it's good for studies and normal work like browsing, attending classes etc. Using it from 10-12 days. Will update with time. Thanks for reading"
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,I have given 1 star less for battery and mouse probs not that they are bad but could be more efficient in this price range. Drains fast and palms keep touching mouse pad while typing. Screen is awesome looks premium. Overall good laptop in this price range. Good for light office work.  It’s been a month since I am using this laptop. The lid of the laptop bends fully backward if you tilt the screen more than 90 degree angle. Upset with this issue.  Thanks
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,After fully recharged Laptop disconnecting the power at the same time battery goes to 90% direct abd after 5 minute it goes under 75%. No consistent time or percentage is shown in Task bar. I found these main drawback when checked.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,1.Major trackpad issues. 2.Battery issue in the first week itself.  1st day - charged well 2nd day - no charge even after being on charge for 2 hours 3rd day - btry drained down to 29% from 68% in 1 hour while being on charge.  1st restart - Trackpad stopped working 2nd restart - started working again  Screen quality is gud. Camera quality is OK for the price point. Looks more beautiful than it does in pictures. Built quality doesnt feel that confident though.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Only thing you might check if it suits you or not is the placement of the webcam (its present very near to the key board, unlike other laptops where its placed on the screen bezel.  Solution: Just by using a laptop stand the position of camera can be adjusted as needed."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,I've very simple words for this product.. It's very useful for study and office work.. A simple Laptop in low price.. Windows S mode is always limited and secure.. Don't demand Hi-fi features.. I'm Satisfied..☺️
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Irrespective of the Brand AVITA, the Laptop overall performance is good. The RAM management and CPU usage is pretty awesome. The Keyboard need to be little better , but adequate amount of usage, one will get used to it. The Boot time is pretty good, boot less than 10 sec.  ** No issue found with the Network connectivity and Applications handling. Overall is specifically made to do everyday use related to MS office applications based work and watching movies."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,I ordered this laptop and i recive it after 1day. But when i tried to start this laptop it did not start. So i put it in charge for 1 hour but still it did not boot up. So i connected the charger and it boot up. But the battery was not getting charged. Bad experience with amazon and this laptop.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Good quality, good configuration and excellent warranty."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,It is a very nice product for this budget. Ordered it for online class and I am saying from my heart... It is a good product. Camera clarity is not that much good... But for students it is really good.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Maska h maska!!!! Display is one of the key feature I like. This is for normal use only. So my office work is smooth and with S mode, it give the security. Battery back up is good. New brand so new experience. Have used hp,dell,Sony vaio but never expect this kind of laptop at such value. Camera is fine though."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"From day one, have been experiencing many issues. Sometimes the trackpad isnt functioning, sometimes a few keys aren't working. The worst experience. Not even good enough to be used by kids."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,So unusually its camera is in the lower part of the screen. Usually its at the top pf the screen. Sp you have to sit on a low chair or lift up laptop to make yourself visible.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Not atall satisfy with product and service, i will not suggest anyone to purchase this product. Its totally waste of money..."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Overheating in just 15 mins. Processor is weak so system running slow. Experience very bad. Display good
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"In it's range it is good product for general purpose tasks, not good for games, it's battery power is average ( not very good Or not bad). Due to SSD memory it's booting process is fast( take less time to start the computer) in compare to other computer in it's range. It is light weight(1.2 kg) small screen (14 inch) portal computer."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I bought this in the Novembers of 2020, The product has served well beyond my expectation. Works brilliant and works super smooth despite SSD space occupied and applications running. very good for browsing, videos, work , movies and lite gaming. Old games like gta san Andrea's, nfs mw, FIFA 11 and many more work super smooth. Its a thumbs up from my side for this product."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,What I feel that a laptop at a prize of tablet.I love it because all my needs are fulfilled by it.what else I want!
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Just go for it.. Neglect all the bad reviews and just buy it. Totally worth your money. The screen quality is Impressive for this price. And I think for gaming you have to go with another and camera quality is also comparable with other expensive laptops.  Overall it's a VERY GOOD purchase.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Value for money laptop is so good and everything is fine but audio quality is not so good overall product is best for basic work
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Picture quality very nice, but slow in even conducting online classes, web cam quality is ok and it is placed very low, when you are in video con you see the screen but others look you as watching at 30 degree above from the level."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Camera position is on the key board and hence the face visibility is less and this is the most important for the online school. Further cant be used for on line exam as while writing the paper it won't be able to view the paper by teacher. Normal laptop has camera on the display screen and you can adjust it below. But for Avita it not possible.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Please don't buy this product. It's totally . Cam placed in bottom of screen that will get bad frame while taking pic or at video meet. In that we can't upgrade ram and also SSD. It's totally waste of money . Go with some others brands.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Keyboad is very hard. Some keys are too hard to press. Called up Service Center for on site warranty as one key was not working. Called up 3 times. It has been one week. No one has come home to repair. Customer service sucks.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Very very bad review from my side. Laptop shutdown automatically. Battery backup very very bad. I recommend don't but it. Please
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,value for money...very fast responce being SSD drive and also battery backup is good around 5 hours . This product is real value for money
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I had already purchased AVITA Pura from Flipkart. Now, My Friend wanted the budget laptop. I searched for AVITA & This laptop came up.

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,I ordered this as an exchange to my old samsung laptop but the delivery guy refused/denied because my old laptop had a small crack on a edge. Glad that he had it taken back. Ideal price of this laptop should be around 13k. N4000 processor is useless even for basic browsing and multitasking. Best deal in this price range would be Acer one 14 which is rock solid and a business class laptop. Only dealbreaker is the full HD screen and SSD but this can be upgraded anytime later.
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,No for gaming only waste of money dont but go for asus waste of money 1 2 3 4 5

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"The AVITAL laptop is worst, wastage of money and time, dont buy it, the camera is just above the key board not with screen which wont allow you to adjust it as per your convenience. To use MS office i.e. word, excel, power point, you have to pay Rs.125*/- to AVITA every month, this is horrible. I bought it one month back now touch pad is not working properly. USB jack is also not working at times. Charger is very cheap, the whole product is made of cheap quality materials. Some of the toys also have the similar kind of charger."

Avita help desk says its not for online classes and can only used for browsing... it unconviceble orgument when the school web application is working fine on a mobile. No MS office too.

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC433-CR-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"I would suggest not to buy this laptop, my Avita laptop battery suddenly stopped working after few months of purchase.  I logged service request but they will give you so many excuses and delay the process. Like part is not available, our technician not available, wait for 45hrs, part is in transit. all false commitment.  I would suggest to buy another laptop DELL, HP etc. If you have tight budget buy it at your own risk, if it stops working after month you have wasted your money, No service at all.."

HP-Laptop-Screen-Windows-15s-du1516TU,laptop,Microsoft Word documents are Not editable. Very very much disappointed... It says unauthorized MS Office
HP-Laptop-Screen-Windows-15s-du1516TU,laptop,Laptop is lightweight. Seems to be cheap plastic. It is of a good speed now as windows seems to get slower over the period. It makes big noise from processor fan which is surprising. I am yet to review other options. Screen seems to be nice. Keyboard is not backlight and seems to be hard. Soft touch is expected with technological advancement.
HP-Laptop-Screen-Windows-15s-du1516TU,laptop,"The specs are great. SSD, big RAM. Works good overall. 9/10. The viewing angles aren't great though. You would not want more than one person watching a movie on this screen."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H80156IN,laptop,"Made the best decision of purchasing this affordable machine. Quick boot up, great for working on Microsoft Office and entertainment. The FHD display makes binging my favourite shows on Netflix a pleasant experience and the bezels are narrow so the screen is always in my focus. The sound quality is good and the backlit keyboard aids in working during the night. Friends recommended i5 11th Gen processor over the 10th Gen or i3 and the difference in performance is evident. With all my subscriptions I hardly store any movies on the laptop and 256gb storage is more than enough."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H80156IN,laptop,"Ordered this yesterday, it is a super light and fast laptop. i5 11th Gen processor is super zippy and the 256GB SSD helps in fast boot up. 256GB is more than enough storage for me, you will be surprised as to how less of storage that we actually use. The display is great with FHD resolution and 250 Nits display and with very narrow bezels. The sound quality is good. The laptop comes with a backlit keyboard which is a nice touch. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H80156IN,laptop,The laptops have hardware issues. Not recommended to buy at all. I had different model which needs hardware repair every 2-3 months.

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The package i has received was well protected and no damage occured. After I uncovering the package and started the laptop, it was so slow compared to my old vaio (sony i7). I was disappointed when it started to process slowly. But after signing and using it, there was no problem and it was running smoothly till now. (No backlighting, no bag, no headphones and mouse) only a laptop, a charger and a manual paper."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"How to install a new SSD? The SSD does not show up on the boot menu. It shows ""Toshiba"" as the first boot device even after physically removing the preinstalled Toshiba hard disk and connecting a new SSD."

Very slow processer. Worst quality. And the worst part is customer services are not even helping they are just asking to contact hp and hp is asking to contact Amazon. I asked to return but nothing has happened. Please please do not buy this product."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,Hp laptop with intel less than 40k.  At starting too much slow. After update working fine.  Hints: No keyboard backlit. No NumLock indicator. Screen is good.

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Was worried about speed issues that many had complained in the reviews. But still went ahead with the purchase. After powering on there is quite a few updates that will happen. At that time i found it to be slow(background downloads and installations will happen) Go to updates and ensure that there are no pending updates. Once all the updates are applied, the laptop is perfectly fine. My kid is using for schools and other assignment. If you are using a browser + MS office applications +zoom(or other vide chat apps), there is absolutely no problem with this laptop. it is absolutely fine. Not sure about gaming though"
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"I got this laptop on 10th of May(reviewing after 25 days). At this price range, this laptop is very good as you are getting 11th gen processor, good display, good speakers, expandable RAM, NVME SSD slot. ___ If you want to buy this laptop for App development or heavy programming then I would suggest you to buy SATA SSD(replace the HHD with SATA SSD) or there is another slot for NVME SSD you can add another here. Also, in two slots of RAM you get 4GB in each, buy two 8GB RAM and replace 4GB rams with 8GB(Upgradable up to 16GB). ___ If you add SSD and upgrade RAM then this laptop is a beast, trust me. I got this laptop @28k after exchanging my old laptop.  If you don't do coding or heavy tasking then I would still say at least add SSD because boot time and performance is average which may annoy you so it's better to add SSD.  Also this laptop is not very heavy gaming like PUBG PC, Apex Legends etc. You may play light game like pub mobile, cod mobile.  Cons: 1. The Quality of the Laptop body is not that good. 2. Battery backup is not good."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,Value for money laptop from an branded manufacturer.

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,Suggesting to go for SSD instead of hdr as it tooks a solid 40 seconds for booting which is very annoying.
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Good laptop under budget with all specifiction required. Little slow while starting, rest behaving good while working. Plastic quality of laptop disappointed this could be better."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,I bought this laptop in July 1st. Within 3 weeks got blue screen error. Then contacted HP support & found that it is hard disc problem. After they replace hard disc we need to setup OS. Issue starts from here. They will send link for OS download but it requires another laptop for OS download and 32gb pendrive for booting new laptop. Since i don't have separate laptop to perform above requirements. I requested for HP service centres support but their answer is they don't support for online purchases laptop. After long struggle finally we took 3rd partly service centre to recover this issue but the laptop speed is very slow. Laptop build quality is very cheap and poor design for reliability. So conclusion is don't buy online laptop. Go and buy in showrooms even 3-4k cost is higher you will get good service
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,Good product .Have decent speed for daily use .The keypad buttons are big enough and feels good .The storage space is more than sufficient .The genuine windows 10 and ms office package come with it .It's light weight and easy to carry.However on flop side the key board is made of plastic whivh could have been better.do not come with licensed anti virus device.The ram speed could have been better and the I3 processor could have been upgraded. Over all it'd decent product for its purchase cost.
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Although it is too early to provide a feedback with only two days of use however I am providing this feedback because the experience is too good till now. Few additional features can add more user friendly experience like it doesn't contains keyboard background light. Also, the first time when you open the laptop, it started taking update from Microsoft. So connect with a good LAN or Wi-Fi and be patient to install the update."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"I just got this yesterday and it took close to 4 hours to get it setup. Even after spending that much time, here are some issues still bothering me.  1. No proper instructions or warranty information present. 2. MS Office was not present. Had to contact HP support to install it..but it still doesnt work. It asks for activation key. 3. Microphone quality is very poor. The person on the other side cannot hear me properly. 4. When i connect the headphones, they are not detected. 5. System is very very slow (probably because of all the software getting updated). But even after 12 hours it is slow so can't exactly blame software update. 6. The plastic and overall quality looks cheap. 7. No number lock indicator. 8. Fan is too noisy and CPU/Memory/Disk one of it is always close to 100%.  So i am thinking of returning this if the issues are not resolved in a day or two."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Product is good . But the processor use little bit lagging. When I power on, after that it will take a time to open a app. Also I don't like the cover skin.  *Products is light weighted * display is awesome cool. *Charging time is less *Sound quality is good"
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"The product was defective and it took a couple of months to just initiate a return . Calling the customer support for help took a while . The technicians didn’t turn up at all. The person who came to take the return item didn’t have patience to turn on the laptop and check the serial number and did not pick up the item . The second time after initiating the return I just received a message that said couldn’t pick up the item from customer . I’m always home , no calls from Amazon but just received a message that the item could not be picked up . I had a lesson that valuable items should not be ordered online ."

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"I am using since 2 months, its very eay to use, easy to install all applications.

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,As of now I didn't face much difficulty but I feel it's working slow I think it needs to update.. Light feature For keyboard provided means it will be much better. After full recharge Battery coming four hours for office work. As given in description it is light weight only..

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"I bought this Laptop considering HP name. However, this Laptop is disappointing. Using for 3 months now. first, it is extremely slow. takes lot of time to startup. Second, it gives problem in running exam software which usually runs on other Laptops. When i click on hardware diagnostic, it goes into restart mode and doesn't come up. i had to shut down restart atleast 10 times and then it came up. Better to get laptop from US, Singapore if you know someone for good quality."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"The product is worst. It is a 11th gen i3 processor, but the performance is dead slow. The display is faulty. Lot of white spots on the display when the screen is black. Poor customer service from Amazon. Still waiting for service arranged by Amazon. They sell faulty electronic items and do not allow refund to return. Who need a replacement faulty device? Bad experience"
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,It’s very slow! I m not a heavy user but it hangs a lot while doing multitask on laptop. Not happy with the performance
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,I don't have any issue with laptop... It's working pretty well. But I ordered this on 9 months instalment in that I had to pay 4883/- per month. But recently when I got bank statement they are charging extra 18% GST on instalments. They are charging 5320 per month. I have to pay extra 4500 rupees I mean it's just ridiculous. Everything should be clear in the beginning. How you are supposed to do like that with your customers? Giving 3 stars just for laptop.

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The display was defective. Also the fonts/resolution is bad. Amazon is however not allowing to return the product. They say only replacement is allowed. Not worth buying such high expensive products from Amazon. Expected the product to be returned and get a refund considering the product to be expensive. Disappointed.
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,Please don't west your money  3months I'm buying the product Every 5days I'm going to hp service center He's clean the ram and hard disk Running performance very very very slowly

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Overall a very good package. Battery life couldhave been improved. It sometimes gets unresponsive for a second or so, but that's about it. But 1TB storage (although non SSD), FHD Display, 11th Gen i3 processor and 15.6 in display at this price point (for me it was 38k) is an amzing deal"
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Laptop's screen broke while working, in just 2 weeks time ! It was not mishandled or dropped. Just broke while using it. HP conveniently says display not covered. Please avoid buying the laptop"

HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"Cheap plastic; doesnt feel like 11th gen i3 processor; my old dual core pc with 4gb ram is faster than this; screen and battery is good; didnt have much expectation from it as it is budget laptop, still it doesnot meet it."
HP-Laptop-15-6-inch-Windows-15s-dy3001TU,laptop,"On time delivery by amazon, appreciated. It is working well. HP need to concentrate on the design to increase the life of the parts.

My old laptop is in good condition fully working condition with no scratches, or any other defect. It met all the conditions as required by Amazon.

It’s did not meet the expectations as per the item description. And Amazon is misleading the public with fake information and without quality check of products they are selling and making the customers fools. I sincerely request to all don’t encourage this product and as well as Amazon as well. This is not 1st time it was happened earlier and I had a bad experience with the same HP product. Finally the same issue has happened. I really fed up with Amazon customer service and products. Don’t believe Amazon especially with electronic gadgets.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82H700K7IN,laptop,An excellent machine for the price for business usecases like MS Office and web browsing. Intel CPU does work well and at cooler temperatures than the Ryzen 3 processors that come at a similar price. Go for it if you're not looking for very CPU and GPU intensive workflows like hardcore gaming and video editing as it has only integrated GPU. The system is extremely lightweight and blazing fast due to the ample 8gb RAM and 512 gb SSD. This is a 1 week usage review. Will post updates if I notice anything else.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82H700K7IN,laptop,"Light weight and slim with rich look, Fast boot, Long battery life, Overall good performance Perfect laptop for personal office use..  I am giving this feedback with 3 weeks of usage."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82H700K7IN,laptop,"Received my laptop along with adaptor today in very good condition, it is a 1 day delivery.  It is a brand new laptop, nice color (grey), light weight and slim, very good configuration too (Intel i3 3Ghz processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB SSD Hard Disk) and i setup my windows and MS Office it was very quick and easy, after installing i reboot windows and it is just took 10-15 seconds which is quick, it has finger print sensor to unlock or to login.  i felt that Speaker volume was a little less than expected and web cam quality was not very good, but still it is good enough for attending online meeting and classes (maybe we are used to high quality camera mobiles and taking pictures in it), so we can't expect the same in this camera.  Unable to check the battery as of now, since i received my laptop only today, i will updated my reviews again after using my laptop for 1-2 months.  Very Happy with my New Laptop !!!"

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82H700K7IN,laptop,"I purchased this PC for my daughter school use.. It has a nvme drive (which is ligtniging fast) and 8 GB ram.  Performance is decent. It comes with some bloat ware like lenovo tools, mcaffee anti-virus etc.. I promptly removed the mcafee antivirus (which is only a trial version), and the perfomeance improved quite a bit.  I wish the display has 16:10 ratio, so it would have been much better for web browsing, online classes etc, but looks like only macbook has this display ratio.  I am now dual booting with Linux Elemenatary OS, and it is remarkably much quicker to boot, much faster than windows.  I am okay with the machine, I would have preffered to save on the unnecessary cost of Windows, as I am not usiing it.  There are also a few brands like HP selling at this price point, I picked this one though due to the lighted keypad and fingerprint scanner.  Camera and speakers are okay.. Just laptop quality.. External webcams will be better."

Also about battery its good if you use it in medium brightness... It's do its work.... Display is perfect with no reflection..... And its buttery smooth, its so fast that within a second the tab opens .... Also go for 512gb one because even you're using just internet it consumes a lot of storage due to updates and stuff..."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Backlit-Fingerprint-82H700K7IN,laptop,If you want to buy it then carry on. This is the best budget laptop with with best performance .

Backlit keyboard is great. Absolutely lite weight. Only one thing is not good is ""Battery life"" It discharge very quickly. Else laptop is excellent."
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Horrible experience with the laptop. First of all I received one product which was a used one then asked for a replacement and now the new one has keyboard issue and Spacebar issue. Don't buy HP laptops these are terrible. Not sure whether it is a fault of the vendor or HP but my experience is terrible with this.
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,"First and farmost thing: Its a pain to have this laptop.  I cant explain the agony I am having for this laptop. I have another HP laptop using since 2007.. hardly faced any issue so I went for HP again. That was my biggest mistake.  I bought it for my 10 years son for online classes, his Minecraft and Robolox. From configuration point it looked perfect. On 12th day, Got blue screen with messages your pc went in to error. Its been now 20 days I bought it, atleast 4 different type of error have appeared on screen and it crashes.  Battery life is 1hr with games and less than 2 hours of normal usage so poor performance there.  Graphics are good ,4 gb dedicated Ram. Good.  Adapter is pathetic. I am scared for my son when he is using , ‘heating up’is a small word for adapter. It boils. I am told by customer care that I have bad electricity wiring, its my fault.  Now worst part, HP customer care. I had worst time of my life with them. Moment you will speak to them, they will start asking you to do ten of tones of things… run commands, screen shots, execute, download software and all non sense. With no results. Have spent at least 15 hours doing what i am asked by customer care… am i HP employee OR I am getting money to do troubleshooting for them???!  For last 5 days still waiting for technical person to come.  Dont buy.. I am disappointed but my son is very very sad. It was a poised gift for him after 1 year wait. Can’t see him like that. Sorry HP you suck.  Update: 11-Sep-21 - after 1 month of struggle, got DoA (Defective on Arrival) certificate from HP. Now I am asked by HP to get it picked and returned to seller which indeed seller will mot do after 1 month. After so many emails/phone calls with HP, finally called Amazon. Within 2nd day, my refund is now issued by Amazon. Thank you Amazon.  5 Stars for Amazon and -5 for HP."
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,"I was looking for a desktop replacement for my home use. Not a hardcore gamer, just a guy played games like COD, Project IGI, GTA, different NFS titles in college and some years after. So while replacing my years old desktop, thought of buying a so called ""gaming laptop"". Requirements were clear - laptop but not necessarily an ultra portable one (as mobile phone works well while on the move), expandable hardware (specially RAM), without any bias for AMD or Intel, fairly latest and must be value for money. Though selected couple of others also from Lenevo and Dell; HP was most value for money of them. And 10th gen Core i5 with 8GB DDR4 (expandable to 16GB for sure), 512GB SSD, 1650Ti graphics card, 15.6 inch FHD display was enough for my need with a budget of not crossing 60k after all discounts - this laptop is a good fit for my requirements.  The laptop build quality is average with full plastic body all around. Be careful, this laptop won't be able to handle a fall. Design wise looks good whether lid open or closed.  Display is crisp and decent for my usage. Its a 60hz display. Avoided UHD or 120-144hz displays purely for budget purpose. Speakers are loud enough and speaker housing has a nice pattern to it adding to overall aesthetics. HD front facing camera is good for video conferencing, though did use it as such apart from testing it.  Keyboard buttons are comfortable and satisfactory to press, but compromised arrow keys and inclusion of num pad, makes it annoying to use. Would have liked a full sized keyboard with a compromised or no numpad. Keyboard is backlit, has 2 brightness settings. Purple LED are bright, but would have liked white LED. Trackpad usability is usual and size is ok. Anyway I use the laptop with a Logitech wireless keyboard mouse combo.  Enough ports are given. The USB-C port also doubles up as power port. SD card slot and 3 full size USB 3.0 ports are enough for connecting number of peripherals to the laptop. Has full size HDMI and RJ45 port for gigabit ethernet.  Not talking about performance in details as lots of benchmark is available online. Overall bootup is fast. Handling of games till 2015 are quite good and some can play even in FHD Ultra settings. Photo editing (gimp2) and stitching large panorama also did not faced any issue and can process RAW images fast and its evident.  Only place where it lacks, is battery backup. Could not get backup more than 3~3.5hrs. I understand for gaming I cannot expect back up like that, but would have liked around 5hrs backup at least for normal use like simple photo editing or browsing or using other productivity/office tool.  Comes with 150watt power adaptor. Charges it quick but heats up quite enough. Did not try charging with USB-C port yet. In normal use it is silent but while gaming fans comes on and they are noisy but not intrusive. Game's sound hide fan noise anyway.  HP laptop comes with some bloatware, some unnecessary mini games and app are preinstalled. Please note, this laptop does not come with licensed MS Office. Its preinstalled with Windows 10 Home (OEM) version, however did not face any issue upgrading it to Windows 10 Pro by linking with my existing digital license.  Overall satisfied mainly due to the performance and value for money offering."
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,AFTER 10 DAYS OF USAGE: Perfect for gaming at default settings. i5 10th gen. Processor works great. Gem at 70k budget Having issue with battery life as it last long 1.30 hrs on heavy usage and 2hrs on power saving mode. So you need to plug-in and play games for better gaming and FPS*
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,"It is a very good laptop at this price range. The speed and performance is good and can be used for multiple purposes other than gaming, like video-editing , photoshop, office work etc. The speed can be enhanced by adding additional RAM. (Most compatible RAM for this model)"
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,"Best performance laptop under 70k.... better performance, good for gaming, good performance in Editing.... Battery lasts more than 3.5 hours with continuous useage with internet (without gaming and editing)......display was good graphic designers can go for it......No heating issues at all...speaker is clear, crisp and awesome it's a different experience on speakers..... hardware is quite good... Design as expected in pictures...  (If laptop lags update windows)  Overall  Good for gaming Good for Editing Good for graphic designing"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Perfect laptop with the necessary configuration for all types of work.
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,"Probably the best gaming laptop you can get for this budget. Gives 50-60fps for most games on high settings. Load times are incredibly fast, and it does not overheat. The battery life is on the lower side. Do not expect more than 3 hours of usage on a single charge while using a video calling app like zoom."
HP-Pavilion-15-dk1508TX-Microsoft-Subscription,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  If you have the budget, GO FOR IT. No need to look on anything else. Firstly, it can be said, a laptop that runs game well does general works well. This model is tremendously fast and capable. I'm playing Days Gone PC at max settings (even with reshade applied to enhance quality furthermore), and no lags I could notice. A great option at this price.

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.  Benefits: - Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter gets warm which is quite normal. - Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs. - Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off. - Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed. - Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop. - Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 20/100. - Touchpad: smooth. - Pre-activated Office 2019.  Note: - Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.  - As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.  - In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know properly how to use it.  - At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.  - Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.  - If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.  - DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.  - Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.  At last, update your warranty to the latest date. Because the laptop warranty automatically starts from the day it got manufactured. You need not panic, just contact HP by email and provide your amazon bill & amazon warranty slip, they will update the same within 48 working hours."

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"I bought this laptop for remote schooling of kids. Observed that 10 mins into microsoft teams, the video freezes. The audio continues. But at this time, the entire laptop is in hung state. There is no option other than hard reboot. Had a call with HP Support. They asked me to update OS, BIOS, which was done promptly. Still the same issue. Do not buy this laptop. Camera is also extremely poor"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"This laptop is overall a really good package, but there is something fishy. It is not Thin and neither is it light enough. The Ryzen processor and Radeon Graphics work seamlessly, but are not for games. Im still not sure if this graphics card is a Vega 6 or Vega 8, due to the serial number. Buy it only if the price falls under 40k or else go for something better!"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Best laptop..Display in awesome...Build quality is also decent... I don't play games..only bought for office use...of your budget is 40k go for it or maybe spend 2-3k extra and buy hp15s eq0024au ...i wanted to buy that but was out of stock for long time
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,I don't know how I missed the review given by fellow purchasers on hang up issues and now I am repenting about it. Bought this laptop for solely for my son's online classes thinking that it works seamlessly. the shocker came when the classes started happing on microsoft teams. this laptop can not handle this app and freezes after few minutes. tried to update all the drivers but of no use. totally disappointed. even the alphabets on the key board are not clearly visible(silver model). I can not return/ replace this one. now I need to raise the problem with the HP care. not happy by the purchase :(
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,I would suggest not to buy this laptop it has 8gb ram but not at all worth. I had installed applications and laptop started hanging I really don’t believe this is hp product. 0 recommendations and honest review
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"MS Teams hangs when the camera is switched on. Very bad product for online classes. When all the children turn on their video together, MS Teams hangs and we have to do a hard reboot. Not sure if this is a problem with AMD or configuration. As far as I know, 8GB RAM should work good, but this laptop does not. We replaced it twice with Amazon and still the issue is not resolved."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Laptop is having 256 ssd and 8 gb ram still hangs while opening simple application and broswsers. On top of that task manager also crashes. Only a hard reboot then fixes the issue. Attaching video poof of booting time. Disappointing.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Repeatedly this Hangs. Processor is very bad. I dont have much applications installed yet it hangs. Not at all value for money..waste of money Posting after a month of use

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Purchased 1 month back. Cons below: Hangs while using microsoft meeting. Everytime you try to share screen and it hangs. I feel cheated after purchasing it now, don’t buy this model."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"The product is really good for its price. Pros: 1. IPS display + anti-glare, great for media consumption! 2. Ssd + Hdd, enough storage! 3. Free Ms. Office for lifetime 4. Ryzen 3 is good enough for studying and office work. 5. Type C port 6. Looks extremely elegant.  Cons: 1. No backlit keyboard. 2. The performance would be better if it had Ryzen 5. (But its quite fast because of the ssd) 3. Built Quality could be better. Also, the laptop being 15.6"", is quite heavy compared to 14"" laptops. 4. Laptop cameras and speakers are never great but they get the job done.  The laptop is working as expected. Not a gaming laptop but extremely good for study purpose- online classes, reading books, web browsing. It's amazing for watching movies and web series! The Ssd makes the laptop fast. I am extremely happy with the purchase. :)"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Doesn't reach expections Go for i3 Processor only. Hangs a lot, Sound quality is worst & you can not return it, body material plastic, usb Ports is very Cheap quality, Honest review Please don't Buy It..."

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Dear Team HP I purchased this laptop on 3rd July 2021. But warranty says it's valid only upto 13th June 2022. Can you please check and resolve?? Once I get the resolution I will share my complete review
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Anti-glare quality is good although there is slight bit lack in screen brightness .....nd off course u can play games except if played in higher setting it get heatup nd fan sound high.....Overall it is worth buying in this price ....
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Received damaged laptop and it has been two weeks that I have been trying to get it replaced or returned. The Amazon pick up person has come 6-7 times now and each time they have a new excuse for not picking up the damaged product. The customer care service has also been absolutely useless. They keep reassuring that pick up will be done tomorrow but the same cycle keeps repeating and it has been two weeks now. The pick up person also does not pick up the calls now. Do not buy such a high value product on amazon. There is no customer service at all and I am now stuck with a damaged laptop.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Always Online Products are having issues, after spending huge money for laptop we are not getting perfect item , this laptop mic is not working properly ,even creating disturbance to others while online calls , it is hampering online classes and meetings . My Voice not Audible to others ."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Laptop has only 2 USB PORTS that too much closer to each other so as we can't use both of them at once. You can not insert any 2 usb devices at once be it mouse, PAN Drive or USB Cable, there is no gap space between both the ports. Using both the ports at once is impossible. If using both at once is not possible, why the company has provided to USB Ports.  Absolutely disappointed and frustrated."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"I got this laptop on 7-May , we use it only for online classes and no other software is installed . Every now and then , The laptop just stops working and hangs , happens atleast twice a day . Please do not buy this model."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,I purchased this 2 weeks back to use it for online schooling purpose. MS Teams and zoom frequently freezes laptop during meetings. I had to force the shut down to use it again . HP technicians unable to fix the problem. I am looking to return this.  update after 2 months .. Issue is not yet resolved ... HP support team is unable to fix it.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"I was satisfied with the overall performance and speed of the laptop. It works well with the WiFI at home and has all the requisite software needed for online classes. The sound is especially clear with headphones. The webcam is quite good and is sufficient for attending meetings and online classes.  However, if you need to know in advance, the laptop does not have a BACKLIT keyboard. It does not appear to be suited for serious gaming purposes.  Thank You Amazon for the superb quality of packaging and prompt delivery."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"I got this laptop from amazon for 41.3 K INR. I searched for many laptops in this price range but did not find many who were offering the SSD+HDD combination with 8GB RAM and preinstalled windows and office softwares. I am using the Ryzen based system for the 1st time. The configuration offered in this price range is really great. I am using this laptop for a week now and mostly do normal computing activities, web browsing, watching movies etc. The booting up and shutting down are really fast...around 20 secs. The sound, display and battery backup are also good. The laptop is new now and lets see how things go with time. I think it is really worth buying this product and will recommend it. If it is helpful, I would like to mention one more point that while buying I had opted for exchanging my old laptop to get some discount... amazon was offering 9.75K flat discount. But since my old laptop was damaged a little in the hinge area and the laptop plastic body, the exchange offer got cancelled totally later during pick up."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"New laptop not switching on. I am quitely disappointed. Dear HP improve your quality check and testing system before product reaches market and customer Poorest service by Amazon. I ordered, defective laptop delivered, ordered for replacement, Wantedly miscommunication between delivery boy and technical person. Customer care executive made me helpless. Asked to cancel order and return. Amazon team made me to miss bank offer, Poorest service of Amazon, Amazon is not customer centric."

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"I got this laptop for my kid's remote schooing. The laptop hangs with Microsoft Teams video calling. Everytime it hangs need to reboot the system. For all the AMD processor and the bells & whistles of speed, it could not handle a simple Teams video call. Additionally i found a slight dent on one side."

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"fraud seller. battery malfunctioned within 2 months. Service team says battery code does not match with there database. Me, as a customer is clueless."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Hi, Got my product yesterday. So I'll share the initial impressions now. The laptop is bit heavy than expected. The fit and finish is good. The screen is very good. The camera quality is just OK, but I think that is sufficient for a meeting. Can't comment on the performance now. I'll update this review after sometime. Overall I would say if you are looking for a laptop in the 40K range, this is a good choice."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Teams was hanging a lot on this laptop. I updated all the drivers, BIOS, and Windows, but still the problem remained. Amazon scheduled a technician visit, but still the issue persisted. The problem was, this product didn't have a return policy, it had only replacement policy. So please make sure what kind of policy is Amazon offering before purchasing the item."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Using it for online classes, normal day-to-day kids works. Additional 1TB is nice where you can store important files and other extra data. 8GB and 3250 ryzen work for anything you know as an average customer. Anti glare display, full HD, and 15.6 inches are good for the average laptop. 16GB ram possible after 1 year of warranty, simply buy 8GB and put in extra ram slot. Great battery backup, gives easily 4-6 hours, but depends on what you run and adjust battery meter on windows. Registered windows 10 and office 2019 (office, excel, power point and onenote) easily. Make sure you select India as language and region, also set timezone as India using any live/microsoft/outlook/hotmail login. Once registered you can clear everything on disk, put clean windows 10 newly, make dual/triple boot. License of windows will be picked up from bios, office 2019 will be picked up when you login using same live login.  Not for high-end graphics gaming, but you can play any game at 720p Not portable, you need to choose between 14 vs 15.6 inches here. Mouse pad is not great, but we use an external keyboard and mouse for kids. Cheap build quality, but wasn't expecting it for a 40K laptop. Felt low video quality, didnt check fully but trusting it is 720p"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Excellent laptop with high speed reboot, good audio quality, long battery life, smooth keyboard, faster applications, no hanging of applications . Thanks amazon and HP for providing good product."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"This is an average grade laptop. The unit I received started giving me issues less than a month of use. Nothing new installed on the laptop apart from what had already come pre-installed from hp. Blue screen errors, touchpad behaving weird and going out of control. Battery backup is the worst. Camera is below average. I might have spent my money on a junk model. Should have gone with some other brand. Under 45k budget you have many other options that one can bet on but not worth putting your money on this at least. Would not recommend this model for sure."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"I bought this laptop for my daughter's school. On day 1 it hung 2 times, freezing the screen. The only option was to hard reboot. Disappointed 😠"

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"* in this price range this is the best laptop to be considered, i have been using this laptop since a month but haven’t found any lag and performance drop if you’re budget is 40k then this can be the best laptop for you.  Product highlights*~*~*~ • window installed in ssd card (which means power on/off is very fast) • keypad backlit is unavailable •screen resolution and speakers are good"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"It is a good laptop, but setimes it got stuck for about 2-3 mins bit that's not a major thing. If you'll disable low power mode. It will work fine because in low power mode it extends the battery and reduces the performance, So, if you do multitasking . First charge it to about 80-90% then disable low power mode, and then use it. Rest, It's a excellent laptop many good features, and the booting is blazing fast."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Execellent product looks like apple laptop material Used and making is excellent and the procesor speed is excellent everything is done through a net connection like warranty activation software installations etc..and this is just a first day experiance lets see after 1 year of use
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It's just amazing! Let me get the details here:  At this price it will be the best buy for office/casual use, average gaming (Haven't played any high res games yet).  • It has 1 SSD 256GB and 1 HDD of 1TB. Windows is  installed in SSD so the loading time (from turned off to start) is near about 5-7 seconds. Usable Ram is around 5.86GB. 8GB is installed in one slot so another one is free to get another ram installed.  • It is very light. It doesn't have a CD drive. Honestly, I don't think anyone use any CD these days. If you use disk then you need to get a usb disk drive. Everything is pre-installed. Windows (of course), all the drivers update, Office 19' so you can use it right  away! • It doesn't have a keyboard backlight.  In short, as I said, at this price this is the best. Trust me, I investigated on Croma, HP world etc. to see if I get any better model (HP) at this price but I failed."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Reviewed it after 10 days of usage. Had to buy a laptop so that my daughter can do her online classes that were 3hrs long. Surveyed a lot and finally bought this. After the initial setup of windows and all, I had shutdown and booted the system again. Within 5-6 seconds after pressing the power button, login screen came up. This is the fastest boot I have ever seen on a laptop. 1TB drive is dedicatedly for storage. 256gb SSD drive is only for the OS, which is good. Due to SSD, laptop boot time is lightening fast. Laptop is not heavy and looks real slim. Just for it."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  1. The laptop screen filled with dead cells/pixcells. I have video and photo evidence. This is ridiculous. 2. There is a scratch on the laptop top. 3. Instead of getting it replaced, you are asking for the technician visit. Didn't except this from Hp and Amazon."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Please do not buy, there is issue with SSD which makes the laptop freeze. Can’t return now and need to follow up with HP 😐. Bad experience."

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Good config for the price. Looks good but heavy. Letters in the keypad are also in body color. So your head needs to be almost directly above the laptop. Not good if you are concerned about sitting posture. Build is good. RAM - Usable memory is only 5.94 GB. You should ideally be getting somewhere between 7.3 to 7.8GB. This is how its designed to work as it uses AMD Radeon Graphics Card. But, on Lenovo, you get 7+GB usable memory for the same AMD Ryzen & Radeon. Warranty had already started but HP corrected it."

I was using hp from 2011 and even today that hp 2000 laptop is working good so I decided to go with hp, I’m a computer science student looking for a budget laptop that can fulfil my needs. I’m using visual studio code for programming and android studio code for android development and these things are working smooth. Battery backup is good but there is no backlit keyboard and the quality of webcam is worst. Due to SSD the laptop works so smooth. If you’re a student and have budget of 40K you can go with this laptop."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"This is a good laptop, and is excellent for home use, after a month or so of use, no complaints.  the ssd really helps , very quick bootup. and lots of storage in hdd too.  used for meetings, in network config with other devices at home like desktop,laptop,printers and wifi heavy use and also connected to Nas network. all good i was not expecting it to do all."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"The webcam is not at all a TrueVision HD quality even it is integrated. It is very poor quality which looks like shooting from a symbian phone.

Hence, I can not recommend anyone to buy this product."

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,This laptop is a combination of ssd and hdd It means its fast and also more space for storage. But the defect is this laptop has no backlight keyoboard. Do not buy intergreted keyboard latops because only 2 times you have change or fix ur keyboard.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Please do not buy this laptop. I have purchased it in the last month and during these days I have to made BIOS recovery thrice. After working for every 1 or 2hours the screen starts flickering. Too bad product !!

This problem is begins after one month of buying this. Not installed any heavy software , just using it for video streaming and my personal documents saving purpose. Still facing that processor issue"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,I bought this laptop for my kids' online courses. The school uses Microsoft Teams. Was surprised to find that the laptop hangs so frequently that it practically renders it useless. They have been using a tablet worth 10k for more than a year and never had any issue. Don't waste your money on this.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Value for money, good in look, light weight . Fast charging, anti glare screen. Keyboard is stylish just need backlit which is missing its beauty. Amd ryzen 3 processor. Thanks to Amazon deliver on next day . Well packing. Full satisfy and Good for more buying experience."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Bought this for my kid to join online classes using MS Teams. This laptop freezes every 20 mins or so while running Teams - the only way out is to kill power and restart. On paper it is supposed that have 8gb ram and a ryzen processor, but basic performance requirements are not met."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Got with Good configuration but the sellers changing rates like anything. A month back came for 38.5k now 42k. Not a worthy buy now.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Just after buying, laptop started freezing in video calls. HP support kept on asking me doing various things like file deleting, reset, driver install but everything failed. Now they are asking me to but 32 gb hard drive so that I can download complete windows and install it again.  Pathetic product and service."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Very sleek looking and useful laptop. I bought this for my daughter for her online classes. The laptop is very much suitable. Not for gaming purposes definitely. But for education it's quite good. Go for it
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Best laptop in this price, writing this review after 20 days of use . Best battery life Screen is good. No laging problem. Suitable for it/ computer engg. students. Just one drawback is the body material is not so good, need to handle gently."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Awesome performance
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Very good laptop value for money and best laptop In this price segment the browsing and file copy is really fast due to ssd drive after three months of use pros Fast speed functionality Have enough storage The video quality is outstanding due to fhd+ screen And graphic are quite preety good The laptop is pretty sleek and thin and can be carried along any place  Cons The true vision camera is not up to the mark The laptop does not have backlit keyboard While playing games it lags  My final review is if u r student or for office work its best laptop the ram and rom available is much more enough to make ur day today life and work easy.I bought this laptop in 42k and I m very happy .
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,HP laptops are good but this laptop is not good. Don't buy. The laptop gets freezed frequently while using Microsoft Team.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Not worth it. Did not work well for online classes . Hangs a lot. Disappointed
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Laptop hangs quite often even with only MS Teams running. Doing a simple task like online classes also becomes a challenge. Even the antivirus is only for 1 month.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Fantastic purchase for online classes  Pros: Good battery life, well lit screen, no reflection, great processor with ample amount of graphics (amd ryzen 3), no lag (while using photoshop), free Microsoft app’s license  Cons: keyboard is little loud and feels low quality, not for games, not for video editing  Overall my son loves this product for his online classes"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Value for money and good for work from home and for study purpose. It takes very less time to boot, I use it for work from home and my daughter use it for online classes. It's serving the purpose, it's more then the expectations. HP should continue making this product."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"This is my first laptop and I am pretty happy with my purchase. Under 40k budget this is a great option, it's only drawback is it's battery.. It lasts about 3-4 hrs( for continuous use) and take 2hrs to get fully charged.. Other than that its Light weight✅ Anti glare✅ Thin ✅ Budget laptop ✅ HDD+SSD ✅ Windows+MS Office ✅ 15"" numeric keyboard✅ All important ports✅ Webcam ✅  Good Battery backup ❌ Screen touch ❌ Fingerprint ❌ Foldable ❌  Overall it's value for money"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Don't buy this product, hardware quality is very poor."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Very nice product for office and students too,no problem at all, every thing is perfect, except sound quality is not so good but not bad to just okok, I gave review after using 25 days so very good product , u can purchase it satisfies your work 🤗🤗😎😎😎"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,It is certainly not for high end software use or gaming. But for general purpose use it works just fine. For economical processor it also costs less & for HD+SSB combo booting is fast & very smooth to use.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"There are few Pros and Cons for this Laptop Pros: 1. 15.6"" Anti Glare Display 2. Hybrid Harddisk with 256GB SSD and 1 TB HDD 3. 8 GB RAM 4. Processor is super cool 5. MS Office is pre installed and activation process is easy. 6. Perfect for educational purposes 7. Light weight and Compact  Cons: 1. Battery capacity is very low 2. Laptop gets heated fast 3. Not a Gaming Laptop 4. Camera is bad"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"The first issue faced is back light bleed. since its an urgent requirement, I did not have much more time to replace the item. so i dint replaced. and OK back light bleed is not a serious issue. you can check the same by searching dead pixel test in internet. when black colous will appear check whether there is any bleed. sound of processor fan is horrible. some time it feel like an airplane is taking off from the mother board. they featured 12 hr battery back up. you will this 12 hr only if you turn on the machine and kept doing nothing. otherwise you will get backup up to 6-5 hr. booting speed 12 sec display looking good physical appearance is good"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"It's not even 3 months and right-touch-button doesn't work (left button works alright).  Without an external mouse, you can not work on this laptop.  Didn't expect this from HP, pathetic."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Doesn't support microsoft teams as intended. Hangs all the time. New laptop genuine OS but still hangs. Not sure about the drivers.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"hanging after every 10-15 mins, some times blank screen appeared which needs to shut down directly to resume your work, no other option."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"It's 23rd day of purchasing. It starts hang after 15 days but since it was hanged a little so I thought it could be network problem or so but gradually it starts hanging continuously despite good network or so. I haven't downloaded any movie, pictures, softwares etc but it is going to hang every time. Return window is also closed after 1 week only. It's my big mistake that I purchased this laptop for my son for taking online classes"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Within 40k range, this is one of the best laptops you can get with 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD and windows pre-installed. I would like to recommend for those who are looking for a laptop for regular web browsing, installing basic office tools and watching online videos with lots of disk space available for storing enough files."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,This product is so good but only problems is that is lags on Microsoft team and hangs but all over its good for normally and online classes and office work
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"I bought it for my online classes and some small stuffs, booting time only 8 secs. Wah so great. Screen is so good. You can do average multitasking, if you think about processor, you can go for other companies like asus lenovo. But HP is more durable in regards of hardware. This ryzen 3250 is dual core, don't get messed with this. If you want ryzen, just search for 4 cores, hope it will be more better."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Excellent laptop under 40k with well known HP brand. Everything is good in this laptop for me. Thanks Amazon and Hp.😊
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Heavy excel file stucks. To boot it takes 3-4 seconds. While connected to network - the battery drains fast. 1 hour or 1.5 hours max without network 3hours to 4 hours. In zoom, sometimes camera not found."

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,The product works fine but the physical memory of 8gb is not completely available as hardware reserve more than 2 gb which cannot be freed. ( Tried using msconfig to remove the memory allocation but looks like no option in BIOS to remove the reservation). So overall memory is just around 6gb. Very disappointed as was expecting 8gb system for the apps I am using. Looks like by design for AMD processor.

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"So i have had an hp laptop for about a year it is not the product which is above but i just wanted to warn anyone checking out these products that do not buy an hp laptop . It is horrible!!!!! There are many software and hardware problems and customer service is Horrible , it is honestly the worst customer service ever.At first you might think that it is a defective laptop but turns out it is an avg hp laptop.Do not go for hp.You can even google the quality of the laptops and you'll find out that MANY people have had terrible experiences.Just please do not use hp ever .Don't even think about it. if i could i would not even give it one star but because i have to inform everyone in need to"
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,If you already use i3 8th generation processors then don’t prefer this because it is comparatively very slow (now I am suffering). Other than this every thing is fine good battery backup .For beginners this is excellent laptop.(in this price).There are some extra benefits for College students with HP brand
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Good for average work. If you buy this to attend Microsoft teams never go for this. It will stop in between. Must get atleast an i3 processor. From my experience i am writing this review.
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"The laptop crashes frequently because of Microsoft Teams. I bought this for my son's online classes. The laptop freezes in between meetings and the only way is to do a hard reboot. I am not sure if this is because of the AMD processor. But there is poor support from Microsoft, HP. There is no proper protocol to raise such issues and get that resolved. The event viewer clearly says the issue is with a few a DLL within Teams.exe and also with another app called LocalBridge.exe which is part of Windows 10."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,This laptop is not good at all for any of the call like for online classes for children etc... this gets lag up when you attend class or office call Plz do not waste your money on this product
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,"Looks and design is good, even speed is ok but when you use multiple programs like chrome and office or Skype together it always got stuck. And crash message start to appear and it start telling you to restart the pc."
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,I have been using it nearly a month and now i am writing the review ...  As i used it .. It doesn't gave me any problem as i am in std 8 so i don't have any heavy work loke gaming and graphic designing.. As through the configurations.. BEST IN THIS RANGE.. I searched for better in this range both on flipkart and amazon.. but i failed and the laptop won.... In the end..  GO FOR IT👉👉
HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,When video or audio runs on a laptop in between sound is breaking (Karrr...karrrr sound is coming ) and gives a very bad experience.

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,Never buy HP products because their technical team has 0 knowledge about their products and they always give stupid reasons ..........

HP-3-3250-Laptop-Windows-15s-gr0012AU,laptop,The 5 star rating is purely for the laptop as i have not purchased it from Amazon.

HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"While setting up the laptop, screen went wonky...total colour distortion and hung up. Have asked replacement....don't know if it's worth buying"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"In specification, mentioned 4 1 Ghz processes but I received 3.0 GHz processor. It is a cheating. Seller take money for high configuration and provide low configuration 😥"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Speaker is buzzing, new laptop, out of the box  Edit: The replacement laptop speaker is the same. You won't hear the buzzing while listening to a song or video however while increasing or decreasing system volume, the chimes crack, also for Windows pop ups, the chime sound cracks at more than 50% volume. Really weird issue."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,It's a awsm laptop with premium looks and great performance.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Great laptop. Even great is that this model shows 2666mHz, but mine laptop displays 3200mhz. In task manager😍 😍. Apps open fast and fluent. Boot up time after installing games and apps heavy ones like gta 5,obs studio, Sony Vegas Pro 14, Photoshop cc, Camtasia studio, fifa 19 and many more apps, still boot up in maximum 6-7 seconds. 🔥 😘. Ssd is nvme m.2 512gb. Great IPS display quality too."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"It was good just for 7 days post delivery. I am not sure if i made a mistake buying it online. Laptop stopped working on 8th day and i had no option to place a request for replacement. I called customer service of HP they said within 48 hrs technician should visit and it's been more than 48 hrs and i have not even received any call. I spent Rs 42k and as i have to do work from home, my work is hampering also. Cpu turns on but no display. Did all troubleshooting but no improvement for this NEW GEN HP LAPTOP.  On 27th HP sent an engineer and they are ready to help howver my case is pending as of 16th April, as Amazon did not mention the serial num on invoice and p-slip. HP needs invoice with Serial number. I am very much disappointed as i am stuck between two big brands...it is good if machine works fine if you are unlucky then may gonna pissed off after sale. Let's see how long do i have to wait to obtain the correct invoice from HP.  Note- accept invoice with sr number mentioned on it then only HP can entertain easily."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Hi, I am totally disappointed with this purchase. I have spend the heavy amount but still i couldn't use the product. My request for replacement also not happened due to some irrelevant reason. I bought this laptop for son's study purpose. Due to this bad sales service my son's study also got impacted. Now this defective item is with me last 10 days. If my problem is not resolved in another two days. I will take this issue in next very seriously. Request your immediation action to resolve the issue. Thanks and Regards,Kajamydeen T"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Horrible experience! First there was flinch in the screen ao i had to talk to the customer service for 2 hours before they declared it fit to be replaced. After I got a replaced laptop within 5 days the speakers went off, they started producing the most obnoxious voices. But till i realised i had to return it again it the 8th day and amazon couldn't replace. So I contacted hp they helped me but everyday i had to sit for hours talking to them explaining them their person came home checked it labelled it suitable to be replaced boxed it seqled it saying amazon will pick up. But nothing! Nor from Amazons side nor from hp its been 1 month now my laptop is sealed and kept. I'm calling everyday mailing everyday but no response. Its like my 50,000₹ have gone down the drain! Horrible services from both sides!"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,I bought HP15s fr 2006tu it was delivered on 27/03/2021.When I was doing simple work but its laptop charger and laptop also getting heating problem so kindly see that and resolve the issue
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"The laptop worked OK for 1 day. The other day itself after starting laptop, screen was frozen. Screen got completely wanky, broken and still. Running laptop hangs up & shuts down automatically. This was happening frequently. Just see the pics.  I requested for return but the process of return itself was such a cumbersome process. Wasn't guided properly by customer care also. I ordered laptop in such an urgent situation that I needed laptop within 2 days. But it took me 2 long weeks for returning the laptop that too after continuous follow up, requests, arguments etc. Worst experience. Trust broken. I very DISAPPOINTED & SAD with the DEFECTIVE LAPTOP received from AMAZON."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Pros 1.Display 2.Very fast operation 3.battery life 4.light weight 5 Msoffice 2019 student life time Cons Body is plastic looks delicate Keypad looks cheap No backlight in keypad
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Print on the keyboard keys is thin(font size and color) . Keyboard body color is silver. This makes it problematic to read keyboard keys. Especially at night when it shines due to room lights. This is bad design. It should be either in contrast color(black keyboard with white font) or it should come with back-lit keyboard. I even did not like display quality.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,If looking for performance this laptop has best config and price comb. Boot in 5-6 sec. No lag. You get windows and office. Packing was good. All seal were intact. It can easily compete with i 5 9gen. But butbut there are some issues First. The plastic quality is not that good. When you type the whole keypad goes down as the plastic there is thin. Battery backup is only 3-3.5hours with averahe load. The mcafee subscription was over when i got the laptop which is weird. But windows defender overcomes the need of any third party anti virus. Overall for performance its the best bang for your buck. Go for it. Just buy a wireless mouse for better effciency Screen is also good but could have been brighter
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"I made this review after using this laptop for 3 months as a good laptop to buy under 42K.I used it for last two months and I only faced the problem regarding battery life. Battery consumed very quickly and also there was a issue of heating. Although heating problem was normal in laptops. Otherwise it was vey fast, response quickly and no lag. The camera was not so good. It was weighing light and thin and also it has a gloomy metal like finish which makes it's look quite awesome. Overall it was good for normal uses . I got this product without any fault and as it was depicted in the display."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"I am working with i5 & i7 laptops and this is my first laptop i3 haven't notice big difference because of SSD and 11th generation version without hard drive. Setup took very less time , very fast processing. Sound quality good and Picture quality satisfactory. Within this cost I must say it's fabulous, must buy and enjoy working. I will not suggest for gaming purpose. Silver colour body makes executive looks, slim and very handy. Light weight and elegant design. I must give five star but somewhere I don't know I am rating four star.....may be something missing like sound card. Overall it's good laptop. Let's see in coming days how it performs and battery life....good luck."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Bought it for 41999, so far haven't faced any issue. Not so good things to consider before you purchase it: 1. build quality: very fragile, won't survive a drop. 2. speaker: average. 3. camera: below average. 4. Missing RJ45 port. I will update my review if I face any issue."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Before purchase I compared similar configuration of Dell Vostro which was 5K less than this HP and Dell Inspiron which was 2.5K more than this HP. Finally I feel better to have this as the Laptop body is stylish and IPS display is awesome.  Only minor problem I had was with McAfee which didn't open when I tried to open during first boot of my Windows 10 however after I restarted it opened but funny to see on my first day with the brand new laptop as it said ""Your trial ended 14days ago"". Since product description doesn't say Antivirus subscription I'm ok with this.  This is my Day-1 experience I will have to see its performance in long run, if any problem I will definitely update my review here."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Very good machine for home user. Got 9500 discount for my old i3 laptop. Thus verygood value for money
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Nice product and good speed
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"I am writing this review after using this laptop for more than a week. I will keep it short and to the point: Good things: 1. I just loved its design and it is beautiful. Soothing silver color and very sleek. it just feels nice to touch the smooth surface. 2. It is significantly lighter weight. 3. Sound is good in this price range, I am satisfied. 4. Speed is awesome. Core I3, 11th gen, and the SSD both make it awesome to work. 5. Display, it is a bit warm display but very clear. Soothing to eyes. Night mode is also good. 6. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. My earlier HP laptop used to drop the connection in between but this works seamlessly. 7. it is very thin, I liked it.  Things need improvement/ I did not like much: 1. It gets heat up in just 30 mins of usage. 2. It has only 2 USB ports that too together with charging port. This makes difficult to connect 2 USB and charger at the same time due to size of pen drive or devices port like mouse or external HDD. 3. The cooling fan is at the bottom not at the sides which may be causing heat up issues because when you use it on the bed as many times we do, it does not work efficiently. 4. Memory of SSD is only 512 GB which gets reduced by almost 100 GB due to OS and all. Of course, this is what is mentioned in the technical specification but this is something which bothers me slightly. They could have given 1 HDD of 1 TB and SSD combination which Dell and other laptops are providing. But this is not that bad. It is fine if you don't store much on the drive and use the cloud. 5. Charger pin which we connect with a laptop is not very smooth. It has a lot to improve. I cannot connect smoothly as my earlier Lenovo, Dell, and HP laptops. 6. It does not have a CD drive which is something missing. People who have old CDs/DVDs of marriages and functions might miss this, I do :(  Conclusion: By and large, this is a perfect laptop for normal usages like studies and work. Not suitable for gaming though. Its lightweight, slim design and soothing silver color appearance backed with 11th gen core i3 processor with SSD makes it perfect and fast to use. I recommend this to users who wanna use it for work and study purposes. I wish the USB port should have been more scattered instead of consolidated near the charging port. Overall, awesome product, I am happy with this."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It seems this laptop has an inbuilt problem... As somebody mentioned in the review, the laptop frequently hangs (lots of pixels appear on screen) and restarts after that... I don't recommend this laptop to anybody..."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Product is very poor. Product finishing is very bad. I have a doubt that whether it is original or not.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"I am using from last few days. Every thing is doing well, amazing speed, no lags, speakers, mic is well. Installation is fast and easy. Even heavy softwares run smoothly. Till now I am fully satisfied. If I found something wrong in coming days I will inform."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"As I buy this since day when I start using within 2 days 1-fan got faulty2- Hanging issue 3-poor service, I have raised issue with HP but they only checking hard disc and saying everything is normal , I have already reinstalled the os but issue is not resolved....Dint buy HP and product from Amazon...."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Scratchy sound from speaker even after reinstalling windows. Requesting for replacement. The replaced product worked well for 3 days but now the scratchy sound is back. Requested for Amazon technician to visit. Post technician visit I had to return the Laptop and Amazon has refunded the entire amount. Based on my experience and online research I would like to state that 11th generation Laptop from HP has audio issues. I have now ordered 10th generation Laptop.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"I purchased this device with the exchange offer, so it was even cheaper for me.. Pros: 1. SSD provides great booting time of 4-5 seconds 2. Smartly placed vent doesn't make it uncomfortable if it heats up a bit...also, pretty quiet 3. i3 11th gen tiger lake cpus are 😎.... Minecraft runs with full graphics settings at 60fps consistently, capable device for coding (not for graphic intensive purposes) 4. Sound is pretty good in this speakers, loud, and crisp, but base could have been better, supports spatial audio(headphone output) 5. Trackpad is smooth, responsive, supports all gestures 6. Active Noise cancelling microphones. 7. 5 hours of battery life (at least) for browsing and video streaming Cons: 1.Camera quality... pretty noisy, 2. Lots of bloatware from HP 3.an ethernet port and micro SD card slot would be appreciated 4. Type c port only upto 4GBPS transfer speed 5. Keyboard might feel soft for some (personal preference)"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Just got it so first observations some might help - There are only 2 USB ports - 1 Type C USB - 1 HDMI Port; 1 card reader ; 1 microphone slot There is no LAN port - WIFI is there but LAN is faster and added value Silver color with light grey typed alphabets and no backlit ; I think HP was playing a joke on customer to figure out keys or learn typing Battery life seems ok; TOUCHED MY LAPTOP AFTER 4Hrs USAGE - CAN COOK AN OMLETTE AT BACK SSD drive is fast so go for it - minimum 512GB makes sense Body quality looks cheap plastic Amazon Prime day sales is a scam - same price and offer available other days Delivery is super and fast laptop is lighter than previous version No MS OFFICE - ONLY TRIAL VERSION WHICH IS SO IRRITATING. YOU CHARGE SO MUCH AND CANT OFFER OFFICE Overall at this price is a good deal Hope it works as good over a longer period of time
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"On 2nd day of use after unpacking the box, all of a sudden the CPU fan started making cranking sound and screen got frozen. This happened again on the 4th day. I am returning it now. Very disappointed."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"The build quality is not so great for the price. Even the keys look as if it's painted in bulk. Could have been black and that d make the device look better.  About HW, whne the tech improved over years, as I had paid 50k for similar config 10yrs back, with i5 core, 1TB storage, DVD RW, 8gb RAM, Radeon Graphics etc, there is no improvement in price now.  Not a config comparable for yhe price expectation over 10yrs.  No DVD, no 1TB storage, Not much RAM and still price is same.  Considering the Moors law by wich the semicon industry swears by, the actual price of this laptop must be 25k ."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,This laptop closed many times. Screen always gets crashed if we are watching any video Or doing any work . And exchange date has also crossed. I m not satisfied with the laptop. Only 10 Or 12 days has crossed.. And arising lots of problem
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Product delivery took time, but was delivered without any issues. Laptop looks good with silver color. Speaker quality is good. Screen quality is good. Boot time is quick. Leight weight and build quality is good (plastic) for this price range. Performance seems good, need to wait and watch. Battery life need to check. Webcam average, still managable."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This computer hanged on first day... I had to force restart it. Battery life is good but for having a SSD it took 1 hour for restart after even first update,"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"A value for money product  Pros - 1. 11th gen iCore processor is very fast 2. okayish camera 3. Faster access to files (SSD present) 4. Wide screen laptop  Cons - 1. Battery life is not what was expected. 2. Position of fan in the laptop is very weird (not in the sides, rather below the display screen) 3. Extreme Heat up during high performance tasks which heats up the display screen (check point 2 in cons)"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Hi, here is my experience after use of 3 months..  It's a good laptop which can do everything as per my requirements.. I m not a gamer or coder. Surfing, dowloading, online classes, meetings etc can be done without any hassle. Battery is 4 hours only. You can watch 2 movies back to back. Connectivity is good. Almost all apps are working. It's very fast due to ssd. On and Off in just 4 seconds. Sound output is good. Microphone is also good.  It's heavy. It's heating much during video call and online classes."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"This laptop I had purchased on 13 August and got on 18. I am writing this review after 10 days of usage. Till now, it is working best. PROS: - Best speed of laptop. Budget Laptop Best display LightWeight Boot time is 8 seconds Incredible speed.  CONS: - No Cons.  GO FOR IT. I will edit the review if there is some problem."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"I purchased this product. First thing i see is built in quality is very poor. made of poor plastic. Battery is daring like hell...Back up is not more than 4hrs. I wanted to return this laptop on 2nd day of my delivery and buy some other Laptop from Amazon. but As per customer service it is not possible to return this laptop, i can only get replacement with same laptop which i don't want... This puts my concerns to buy any electronic product from Amazon which you have not seen physically. Better to buy this type of products from Local electronic shops though they are bit expensive. I recommend not to buy this laptop online, You will not be able to return or get replacement with other laptop models if you want to.... Worst experience ever...."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Received a faulty laptop, amazon sent an executive next day and confrmed the same. Thanks to Amazon for approving the refund, however pick up guy delayed the process of refund."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,No point of getting into technical details as the basic body design is problematic. The edge is ao sharp that if you are using it for long time the sharp edge puts pressure on your hand around the wrist area depending on size of your hand. For someone wanting to use laptop for long hours its a curse. But the machine has no return policy.  Even the keyboard contrast is not really eye friendly. Real disappointment on basic design front.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,The seller Appario private limited delivered me pre used one. When i try to activate the MS office 2019 product key which is not activated because it is already used and the product warranty shows only 10 month remaining. It is not a good practice the seller delivered a used lap. Returned the lap and amazon issued refund without delay.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Got a good exchange deal and a very good and smooth laptop Booting is really quick. Haven't noticed any lags after one month of use. It is light weight and easy to carry. Though sometimes it feels that the screen movement will get loose soon. My only complain is with Amazon, for using huge boxes and lots of dunnage to pack the laptop box. It is unnecessary wastage."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"It's a light weight laptop and quickly boots and shut down. Biggest flaw in this laptop is, it keeps hanging every now and then. You must restart and reconnect to your meeting or classes.. Please don't buy this.. I had very good laptops from HP earlier but this is not worth it. Avoid buying"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Window operating system clash with one week, hp service center denied to attend, as per discussion with them there is no any issue at hardware side so they do nothing.gave customer care number of software site of hp for on line support,"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Recently for my earlier pc (from hp itself) I came to know that the extended warranty, I had taken was of no use, when it came to changing the expensive battery(this is the part which most often goes bad) so when it comes to getting the battery replaced, extended warranty of no use.... This was such a pathetic experience...."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Worst product screen flickering issue & restarting issue..waste of money
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,The free antivirus that comes with the product was already expired. Also the warranty for 1 year was reduced . Laptop stopped working within a week of purchase. Seems that a used piece was delivered
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Delivered a day earlier. The laptop is exactly what I expected. The SSD makes a big difference in the speed of boot and usage. 8GB RAM with the laptop is required as even without any applications, Windows10, antivirus and other startup programs takes up more than 40% RAM. Alexa is a good add on. All in all a good buy."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Please don't buy this laptop.i purchased this laptop , within 10 days I found many issues with this laptop.some times system gets hanged.im facing lot off problem with keyboard,caps lock automatically on Nd it will not respond even if we try to off.Finally my opinion is not to buy."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"The product quality is really bad. Laptop's plastic quality is so bad that while holding the laptop, you will feel the laptop can break any time. Not expected this kind of quality from HP. The keyboard is another big issue here, the characters on the keyboard are very light and are not visible even from 1 meter away. You need to bend down and type the letters. Lastly the amazon service support is also poor, as per the policy they would not replace the product if there are quality issues that I discussed above. They will only replace in case of defect."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Worst product..... after operating the laptop for 5 minutes the screen got invisible.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,It's been only two days my laptop is not charging .wow my brother have same laptop but luckily not purchase from Amazon because Amazon always have habit to delivered defective or replaced one. I will suggest not to purchase laptop from Amazon better purchase offline when I asked for return there a huge long process how I mean and here we are suffering like hell.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,This product firstly don't have a Ethernet port which is a big drawback for such a good spec laptop.. performance is good no doubt .. however considering internet as a priority ..HP has disappointed us with just a 50mbps throughput wireless adapter.. And i don't have any clue whether external usb to ethernet would work and if works what would be it's throughput.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Laptop was delivered on time and works very well. HP laptops have a good build quality and are sturdy. For anyone looking for a reliable laptop which can be used for routine computing, this laptop is definitely worth considering. Came with a long adaptor cable as well making it convenient to work with. Good pricing and excellent online support are additional benefits."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,fingerprint sensor not on system but on a paper within the box.. backlight sensor only in picture actually missing from keypad F5.. Battery 3 hours max that too for a basic school purpose..
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,I bought this laptop for my daughters who are attending online classes. The product proved to be very useful for their requirements.

HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Fast processing, very easy to set up and start using. Only thing i felt that can be improved is the display. Otherwise perfectly great choice. Boot speed is really good. Best product to buy in this range."

HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"The laptop got crashed after 18 days. Not able to start it, on starting it says boot device not found. Raised issue with HP customer care, they were not able to solve it and told somebody will contact for part replacement but no body called till now. Did not expect that Amazon will send faulty laptop. Pathetic service from Amazon and HP."

HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Good laptop
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"This is a good value product from HP and it is priced well for the configuration. However there are certain small things to note. I am using this laptop for 2 weeks and I find the build quality to be ok not that great. Dell, Lenovo laptops provide better build at this price. It has some flex near keyboard and the overall chasis does not feel solid enough when you are typing for long. Also since there are speakers on the top the keyboard is positioned at a lower level as a result you cannot use the lower rows of keys by keeping your palms in the palmrest which is not good ergonomically. The key font is also ineligible in certain lighting conditions as there is no backlit keyboard. The quality of the power button is unsatisfactory. Sometimes you cannot feel if there is actually a keypress. There are only 2 usb ports which are located not only on one side but very close to each other. So all accessories may not fit depending on their size. I would have also loved if Hp had provided a 180 degree tilted screen like Lenovo laptops. Also the laptop is a dirt magnet. It catches ink from ball pens very easily so be careful. Performance and battery life is good enough for office work."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"At first I would suggest everyone of you to buy any electronic gadgets such as laptops, phones from offline. I've not bought it from Amazon. The laptop quality is amazing in all the way and has a very nice gesture. It's anti reflective, so if you want to work 9-10 hours, it won't harm your eyes. It's FHD display and awesome graphics made it unique by itself. It's definitely value for money!!"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"Laptop keeps hanging and shutsdown automatically, it's been 14-15 times since the day I purchased... customer care do the system recovery and says now it's ok but after two days same case...no proper reply from customer care..ease replace the items if Amazon executive listings please respond...my hard earn money wasted."

HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,"This time, wanted to surprise my wife with a new laptop as replacement for an old Samsung AMD 6 GB RAM machine, so i had procured this with exchange as an option. However the screen had dark spots, which the agent delivering the laptop did not accept. Feeling extremely unhappy, that the process of exchange was not clear."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fr2006TU,laptop,Don't buy this laptop because from the very beginning of purchase its not act like 8 gb of ram and 512 gb of ssd card.it cant handle a single app like chrome. waste of money. suddenly it getting shut down while we are doing work on it. 1 star is also less for this laptop

I think for the price, you shoud get a backlit keyboard. Other than that, the performance and the battery life was great and the build quality is really good. If you are considering a laptop in this price range, I'd highly recommend this one."

HP-Processor-39-62cms-i3-1115G4-15s-du3038TU,laptop,"I purchased the order on Jan 28th and got the delivery of the laptop on Jan 30. I bought an 8 GB RAM version, when I started using the laptop, it was hanging, lagging, and running slowed than my 10-year-old laptop. I spoke with HP and they told me that my laptop was registered for the warranty on Dec 2020. I was shocked. There were multiple files in TEMP folder from May, Sep, Oct and Dec 2020.  In the name of BRAND NEW product, the seller is selling OLD/ REFURBISHED product. BEAWARE before you buy it."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-i3-1115G4-15s-du3038TU,laptop,Pathetic experience... while having 8gb RAM performance is very slow... battery run for 2-3 hours.
HP-Processor-39-62cms-i3-1115G4-15s-du3038TU,laptop,"Processing is dam slow. My dell laptop which was purchased 10 years back is faster than this. Tough they say i3, 11 Gen and 8 GB Ram, do not fall for this. It's absolutely rubbish. Sincere advise, do not buy this product."

HP-Processor-39-62cms-i3-1115G4-15s-du3038TU,laptop,"I was delighted to see affordable laptop with Intel i3 11th generation with good specs. From the time I opened the machine I felt let down by HP. 1. The build quality is really bad. This is my Third HP Laptop and none of the ones I used before had this poor plastics. 2. The camera is another huge letdown. 3. The major cause of worry is the performance of the system as whole. Though it had better performing Processor and 8 GB RAM, every app takes time to load, horrible lag right from the first time I started the system. Please refer to the attached Screenshot - with just one broser and explorer open the Disk, Memory are shooting up. Everytime I check two of the 3 parameters (Disk, Memory, CPU) will be hovering around 85-100. Not expected of a new machine. I feel very low to know the investment is bad right from day 1. I think HP wants to milk the rush to buy laptops during Covid lockdown by WFH/Study from School kids. Hope Amazon will pass this feedback to HP as well."

They could be seen with difficulty only when the key board is tilted. But, in the tilted position, the laptop cannot be used. Disappointed.

HP-Processor-39-62cms-i3-1115G4-15s-du3038TU,laptop,"Got it for a really good deal during Republic Day sale at 36k with Card offer and 1k coupon. Overall its a really good deal. The only downside I see is with the storage it comes. its only HDD, and in this year of 2021 HDDs are super slow and SSDs are must. So I also bought a 240GB SATA m2 ssd worth 2k. It will move the windows to SSD once I receive it.  But that will ruin the warranty. So if that's not something you want, please go for an SSD alternative like this laptop here : ..  otherwise it is one of the best laptops in this range for video editing, word processing ,Skype video calling , slight gaming .You can play GTA v at the minimum settings but don't expect anything better at this price.  ###Pros#### - i3 11th gen is similar to or better than i5 7th gen - Battery backup is really good if you only use it for movies, reading and studying etc -Internet speed is exceptional - Web cam is ok - Build quality and design is something different from the old bulky HP laptops and its really good. - Lightweight  ###CONS### - slower HDD is a deal breaker. Trust me the performance difference is really noticeable with SSDs"
HP-Processor-39-62cms-i3-1115G4-15s-du3038TU,laptop,"Everything is hanging, takes 10 mins to boot up. Absolute waste of money. Please do not buy this product and lose your money."

HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,The laptop DOES NOT come with AMD Radeon Graphic Card (As mentioned in the description about the product). It comes with Intel Graphics.
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"Was bit apprehensive to buy since there were absolutely no reviews or people who purchased it before but went ahead since seller's review was decent and I am so happy that I went ahead to buy this product. Perfect in every sense, very swift because of the SSD storage, screen and laptop body are stunning and have no defects. All the features as promised in description plus there's 100gb Dropbox cloud storage 1 year subscription free to which I was fairly surprised but really elated as I do use Dropbox regularly and recently completed my subscription period. In all a perfect laptop especially in just 35990. I would suggest to go for it. Also it has backlit keyboard even though it's not specified in description."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,very good product of Acer in this range 1. Display quality is very good. 2. Keyboard's backlight feature is excellent and the keypad is also smooth. 3. battery backup is 5-6 hours. 4. Easy to carry because of its lightweight. 5. MS office of 2019 is preloaded. 6. I was expecting a window 10 pro version but it is a window 10 home. 7. Ram is 4GB was expecting 8GB. 8. Speaker sound is a bit low. 9. Trackpad could be more improved. 10. Laptop's extended warranty option is not there on purchasing from Amazon but it is there on the Acer site. Overall it's a great deal in this budget by Amazon.
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,I love this product good build quality and great performance at this price range and i surprised that it has backlit keyboard.
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"I got it for 36k. Thanks Amazon for the rapid delivery 💯 I'm a Marine Engineering Cadet and using this particular product for studies, attending online lectures, meetings and official work alongwith normal day-to-day tasks.  Here are the points that I want to share after 1 month of rigorous use :-  # This model with SSD is superfast and even with 4gb of RAM it handles all of your normal tasks easily. Best suitable for Students and Office work.  # Don't expect the webcam to be as good as your smartphone, its 720p and provides decent output.  # Display quality is very good considering TFT type panel, but has an anti-glare coating with appreciable viewing angles.  # Keyboard has got backlight feature and the keypad is smooth and responsive.  # It actually feels lightweight while holding probably due efficient weight distribution👍  # MS office of 2019 comes preloaded but you have to activate it for the first time (requires internet)  # 1st boot takes only about 10-12 minutes and it's ready to use ✅  # Trackpad is good enough with pricision touch and muti-finger gestures (no fingerprint scanner) , I saw some reviews mentioning its quality but honestly bro, at this range what did you expected 😄  # window 10 home (not pro) with DropBox for 1year and Norton Security Ultra for 1month (Acer Laptop gets privilege for 1year extension @ Rs.99/-)  # Speakers are decently loud, sound is a bit low but quality is excellent. (Yeah it does have 3.5mm headphone jack 🎧)  # Regarding battery backup :- I'm using intelligent charging feature that charges upto 80% for a longer working life. (80% to 30% battery drop experienced within 4 hours with PDFs, MS Office, PowerPoint, Excel, photos and videos.) Hence, you can expect 100% to 0% will give 6.5hours of backup easily with all these tasks 👍  # You can add HDD but I'm using an external one.  # Regarding types of ports :- Ethernet, USB 3.1, HDMI USB type C, USB 2.0, Locking Port and LED indicators  # Charger is also quite small, I didn't expected that honestly and it charges from 30% to 80% in 1hours 15mins  It was a great deal and you can go for it"
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"As far as basics are concerned, the laptop pretty much nails them well. A great screen, good keyboard (the Numpad is a bit cramped, though), and excellent sound. A decent selection of ports and a big touchpad are added bonuses. Also extremely lightweight, still has a good enough build quality, the top is aluminum and is cool to touch.  The i3-1115G4 processor handles basic tasks well but can struggle with heavier tasks like video rendering and all. The 4GB of RAM and 256GB of NVME storage offered out of the box is enough for beginners, but an upgrade is highly recommended. A kit to install SATA SSD or HDD is provided in the box but requires to tear through a factory seal on one of the installed screws to open the back panel. Boot timings out of the box are really quick.  The processor and the display do support some form of HDR, but I couldn't really figure out the effect it had. The panel is 1080p, which only a few laptops have in this price range. You can lay the display flat with the body, but i have not yet figured out the usecase for his mode.  Activating Windows and Office 2019 is an easy process, and there are always Youtube videos on how to set up a new device if you are ever stuck.  The backlight comes on automatically on the boot and needs to be turned off. It has two levels of brightness.  The context menu button, which is absent on almost all new laptops, is present here.  The power adapter is rated for 65W and feels delicate(?). It is compact and can be chucked away in a corner easily.  Now the shortcomings: It lacks a few good to have features. There's no light on the Caps Lock button or the mute button; you need to rely on software prompts to check them. The sound played on plugging in the charging cable is jarring and sounds like something is wrong. The power button is integrated into the keyboard and has no LED on it.  Overall, if you need not run heavy software like Solidworks or ANSYS or heavy games, and do only regular stuff like office, movies, etc., then you will not be disappointed by this."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"The laptop is good for basic home use. Not expect high end performance. RAM is 4GB which is very less. Should have given at-least 8 GB. SDD is also 256GB only, require 512 GB. i3 processer is 11 gen but 2 core only. Better to get 4 core processer. Screen is not IPS. So, experience is average."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,Quite surprised seeing the back lit keyboard as it was not mentioned in the specs Pros😁. Great display nd sound quality Good battery backup(easily 5 hrs) Backlit keyboard Fast due to the ssd Ms office  Cons🥴. Charges quality not upto mark but is justifiable at the price Camera quality. Just average. Ram management is gud but planning to upgrade ram and add hdd
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"Smooth, breezing, light weight, very good laptop for office work, awesome screen quality, boot time, app opening very fast. Good for light gaming /editing although keypad and bottom area gets a bit hot. Would definitely recommend to someone who is looking for personal laptop for wfh purposes and daily normal use case scenarios on long term basis."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"Perfect For Day to Day use, Excellent combination of Speed with powerful 11Gen Processor. Very Light Weight, Looks Premium in Silver Color  Just go for it you will be highly satisfied."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"Built is sturdy, unlike HP which is a cheap plastic body and I had to discard within 8months of use, display is amazing, key pads are superb, looks beautiful, quick to restart, and picture (video) quality is the best. Audio can be improved. My strong recommendation is to go for it and avoid HP if you are planning for one. HP has horrible customer care service inspite of even writing to CEO and some of board members. Trust me...."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"The product is a great deal for those who are searching for a laptop withing 40K. The screen quality is satisfying and the speakers work well for individual use. Coming to the speed, I don't have many files on my system but do much coding work and the speed is up to the mark. You may face battery draining issues as it takes about two hours to get fully charged and drains in 6-7 hours. Connectivity with bluetooth and wifi is as expected. Overall, a worth buying product for students and official usage."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"Well it's a good laptop at this price range. If u r a regular user for doing documentation and office work, then it's a perfect one. Go for it."

Pros-  It has a 256gb ssd with 4gb ram and i3 11th gen processor.  Future proof- Its ram is upgradable up to 20 gb( 4 gb inbuild and has a empty slot for upgrading up to 16 gb) and you can also add a 2 TB hdd in A extra slot.  Average battery life., and average sound quality.......average gap among keys  Cons -  -there should be a better sound quality  -lifetime license of MS office  Conclusion you can purchase it without any prob."

Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"I received the product 10-05-2021 overall good ,beautifull thing is backlit keyboard ;performance also good! Nice product go for it."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,In 37k u have to give atleast 8gb ram or 512 gb ssd..in 34-35k u should go but in 37k its average
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,Not good service and return pokicy is bad. Service wise its not a good oprtion. Delivered late and gone return on exchange.. Not good service
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"Very nice , I like it, really it is working fine and Performance is very very excellent, I am so happy"
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,"Hello ppl I am writing in distress. I bought this thing with 16gb ram 1 tb ssd from acer store and it was delivered less than a week back. Today, after I had hibernated it, it has refused to start. I am getting blue screen with mouse pointer responsive. But since it's a public holiday and weekend, the company is dead. No support, take ur risks. Even went up to the escalation matrix and they were rude to say the least, unhelpful being part of the job. My job is at stake but the gentlemen tell me it's late and not done at this time of the night. A fair appreciation when ur job is not at stake coz I cant recover data I produced in last three days by monday morning when their support opens up. Well I guess u pay for ur mistakes. First time I trusted acer instead of hp/ asus/ dell and the lesson is hard. Take ur risks guys and buy it.  Update after a yr. the laptop has its own mind wrt the shift key. u cant work on it. acer says we dOnt have record of having SolD it to u> they are asking for an invoice which they NeVer sent. when I had asked for an invoIce, they had told ME WE KEEP DIGITAL copies FOR EnvironmentaL stuff> now they seem to have changed their mind> go figure !!"
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-Laptop,laptop,Worst experience too high cost I am amazed don't buy hdd variant it's not sad its HDD variant don't get fooled
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"It's a great general purpose laptop. I got it for 41.3k, and though its original configuration is fine too, I added 8gb additional RAM for 3.2k, so for 44.5k I've got a laptop that's blazingly fast for general use. I don't use it for gaming, only for office work and as a home computer, and for that it's fantastic. Boot up time is 5-7 sec, shutdown is 2 sec, Windows 10 and MS Office are pre-installed with lifetime validity. I have a similar HP 15 with the Ryzen 3 and though the specs on that are better on paper, the i3 version seems to be far better in real world performance. All in all, a great buy.  Update: One month plus of regular use of around 10 hours a day and everything's still as great, no problems at all have come up in this duration."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"System works smooth with 256,GB SSD and 8gb RAM. Got Win 10 OEM and MS office Home & student active. Booting up within 20sec. Expected Graphic card of 8Gb AMD Radeon. As it was mentioned in details but came with inbuilt Intel UHD graphic 4gb .. which was a disappointment. Also expected 2 Usb port and 3.0 port but it has 2 usb 3.0 ports and 1 usb C port. Haven't used for more than 2 days will update later.  Update after 2 weeks.. After all windows updates ,laptop performance has improved.. Gives a battery ackup of more than 6hrs with heavy use. Full charge within 2hrs."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,It does not have AMD Radeon graphics
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"Great laptop in this price range..only disappointment., graphic card and ram mentioned incorrectly..but came with inbuilt Intel UHD graphic 4gb .. which was a disappointment.. Else would hv given 5star.."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"Product is awesome just 1500 ra expensive as i was getting same from authorised dealer for rupees 43500 with bag which cost around 1000 rupees so basically laptop alone will cost 42500 and here on Amazon it is selling for around 44000 rupees however I purchased this because I was able to exchange my 9 year old laptop for 8750 rupees that's a steal for me. I paid 34244 rs net.  cons:  JUST 2 USB PORTS, SHOULD HAVE ATLEAST 3 ALSO THERE IS NO GAP BETWEEN THOSE 2 PORTS AND SOMTIMES ITS DIFFICULT TO PLUG TWO DEVICES TOGETHER."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,Good product for basic use.  Kindly avoid if you are looking for gaming purpose.
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"It’s a great laptop for general office use..works smooth.. battery life of almost 6 hrs..The materials used are great,Matt finish looks great only think which I didn’t like is that finger prints are too visible on the materials ..I would definitely recommend for office guys and students"
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,Scrap plastic useless box. Motherboard and usb port faulty manufacturing defect. Approached customer care and not ready to replace. Horrible experience.purchased on May 2021. It's cheating and eating our hard earned money by hp.
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,I cant install and activate the MS OFFICE in the new laptop(mentioned as pre installed)
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"Good value for money! Hybrid 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD gives fast booting helps on and off faster! Good standard 8GB RAM gives speed while multitasking and data reading, also it can upgradable to 16GB! Camera is also clear, dual speakers are good while attending online meetings and school lectures but not for watching films or listening music though one can easily attach Bluetooth headphones or speakers! Alexa comes inbuilt and mikes besides camera works superbly! Negatives are- No fingerprint lock/unlock function, Anti glare makes screen darker while tilting and keyboard is without backlight. Overall a good laptop for Schooling, working & occasional movie watching!"
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Pros- good battery, speed and looks Cons- no visio, no project and outlook in office forstudents. 10th gen processor and display is just fine no hd etc."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,Pros 1 Good Specifications 2 Decent Build Quality(Not the Best) 3 Great General Purpose Laptop 4 Speakers and Battery life are Very Good 5 Good for Multi tasking (8gb ram) 6 Fast Boot time (256gb ssd)  Cons 1 Display Not the Best(But Decent) 2 Laptop hinge looks Weak 3 Not Recommended for Graphic and Prossessiong intensive tasks(i3 2cores) 4 Poor Webcam Quality  * It does not come with Radeon Graphics * HDD is 5400rpm
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"I ordered it during sale at 41K . Unfortunately could not returned it during return window.  Its not at all worth the price. It's terribly slow. Don't go by the configuration.  I am a Dell and Apple fan, bought HP first time. My 7 year old Dell laptop has much more faster performance and good built. It was bought at same range 40K  Only good things about this one are loud & clear sound quality and its light weight. All other things bad.  Would not recommend it."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"It's a great product. Got it for 41k. You can work for almost 5-6 hrs once battery fully charged. I3 processor is good enough for your daily office work /Surffing Or online classes. With 256 GB ssd and 1TB HDD, pc boots really fast. Just go for it before the price of this product shoots."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"Reading good comments here, bought this. Been using this since 3 days, and I see slowness, installed only chrome. Chrome doesnt open fast, had to do some diagnostics to improve performance (marginal). I have now scheduled a technician visit, if that doesnt solve, I'm returning.  After writing this review, I see good performance :) not sure what changed. I believe, the OS was downloading stuff and optimising. Have been using this since a week now and no complaints"
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"Two weeks since I got this product delivered. Daily usage is good. SSD makes sure of fast startup and system usage. Additionally the 1 TB HDD is useful for storage. Warranty is updated correctly once you setup. Some bloatware exist as you would expect from any laptop with pre-installed software. Some of the keys are a little hard to press, but not too much. The power and charging indicators at the sides might make people desiring for a better design.  There is no graphic card. While SSD might make game faster along with 8 GB RAM, lack of a dedicated graphic card means it's not that good with games.  All in all, it is a fine one if you want for daily usages or programming/study."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,The condition of Laptop was  1. Power Adaptor missing 2. Laptop not working 3. Looks like old used laptop delivered 4. User manual also not given in box 5. Packing condition also not good  Very very bitter experience. Requested for replacement. But Amzone is refusing for replacement.
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,The laptop has all features that are deemed important for wfh and for online sessions. The online concern was that it gets heated as there is a vent just near the lap which will prevent you from using it for long hours. Hope this helps!
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,best performance... very good speed (8 gb ram sufficient) 256 gb ssd in special C drive...good very good model & thin model...

Furthermore it has great space from its 1 TB HDD. Overall an exemplary product at an affordable price. Unfortunately the only flaw was the tricky activation of Ms office package.
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,One of the worst ever product I received from Amazon. First this is not a brand new product deivered to me. It a refurbished/used procut by someone Product seems entirely defective. Battery not even lasting for 60 minute after full charge Its not getting power on.

HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"I use it for official purpose. Laptop is very fast for it's ssd card. Of course not for gaming purpose as it has no graphics card. Slik, light weight. I am happy."

HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,I didn't find anything in this laptop to pay such a huge amount like 43k. You can get it in 40k easily in your near stores..then why should you pay more
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"The so called Amazon falsely sells the products stating 5% cash back will be given on using AmazonPay ICICI credit card. I spoke at least 10 times to customer care agents, it has been >30 days. No cashback is given to me till date.  Worst customer service, they don't understand the simple ask of customer. Reroute calls intentionally without providing any resolution and hung up the calls.  I feel, could have purchased this item outside. Please don't make false promises and cheat customers!"
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"Super.Only only default the price is flucating. I brought for 42.5. However, now tge price is 1200 less, dissapointed with the price."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"It's one of the worst products from HP. Do not buy this laptop. Ever since I have bought this laptop I have resorted to only curses for HP company. It's so slow in operations that you can take a nap before your lot opens, a document gets saved or when you are switching it on. And don't even think of connecting it to your wifi because all it does after that is updates and updates and with those updates it takes years to complete. Try opening Google chrome on this laptop and you would be shown what snail's pace means."
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"The laptop has a really fast Boot Time, there is no lag and i guess Windows 11 upgrade should be on its way  Very Slim and only concern is USB ports areboth near to each other and only on one side :("
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,The laptop is good & immense amount of storage & speed is okok . bought it in wholesale market for 42k with accessories. Will suggest you to buy any ryzen 3 4300U processor over this. but if you only want intel this is good.
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,Booked this laptop for exchange of my dell. It's 7 yr old laptop a decently maintained. Delivery person upfront rejected to take it as it is having minor crack on the frame. It seems they are expecting brand new one to be exchanged. ... Beware of exchange program...
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,"My brother bought this laptop for he's kid and we got multiple issue performance and alot of bloatware application and when asked for replacement we was suggested to upgrade ram, we regret buying Hp rather than going for other brand worst product. Even ms office was for 60 days validation"
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,Very nice laptop. I bought it for 42k and in 6 months the price is 48k shocked by the price hike. The hybrid drive is very useful and the 8gb ram does the job in ease. This is a beast under the hood. Can't ask for a better deal in this budget.
HP-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Windows-15s-du1066TU,laptop,Overall a good laptop. Considering an 8gb ram the speed is a little low but can be acceptsd. Worth the buy.

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-CR-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,Very bad
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-CR-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,"Hello, I'm writing this review after using this laptop for a month.  I bought this product for my daughter's online school education. As such this laptop does pretty well on that front. No doubt that Avita has cut lot of corners to provide a product in this budget which should be expected, afterall laptops with decent performance are not cheap. Buy this if you only intend to surf internet, online learning, emails and work on MS Word or such document softwares. As the processor is very basic don't have much expectation for gaming or any other processing heavy programs.  Positives: 1. Screen is gorgeous with minimal bazels. 2. Weighs really light. A kid can easily handle it which translates into less chances of damage. 3. Good on-site service. I placed a request, the technician visited next day and was able to address my concerns. 4. Sufficient battery life. 5. Looks cool and different. 6. Good enough camera. 7. SSD provides smooth performance. There is no lag whatsoever. Laptop boots up within some seconds. Got 192 Gb usable space out of 237 gb. Connect external hdds or usb drives if more space needed.  Negatives: 1. Wifi range is poor. 2. All the ports are at the back which makes them hard to reach. 3. Positioning of the camera is on the keyboard surface which gives no flexibility to manage its angle. However, apart from an awkward position, there is no hindrance in capturing the subject using the laptop. 4. Power chord length is quite short. 5. Track pad isn't very smooth but manageable. I had to bump up its settings in Windows. Using an external mouse will provide better experience.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-CR-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,"The product is good but it has some problems , first If your thinking that you can do gaming in this laptop , then it will not work , DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP FOR GAMING, you can use it for office work and normal students type work , 2nd amd most worst part is you are not going to get its accesories , because AVITA is not known in India."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-CR-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,"After reading so many different feedback on different products I made my self to order this laptop which is not so old and trusted brand let me tell you , but the most attractive things of this laptop is it is providing same features which is there in other brand at high price , but this the only brand in the market which comes below 25k , thats why people get attract , but using this laptop for only one day, it is not even twitching on , seems like dead automatically I have request to call centre and asked them to replace,amd I trust amazon it is known for its service over the world so no meed to worry about ... Thank you"

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-CR-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,"Comes with genuine windows 10, and also office installed but not activated. Camera quality is ok, but position is weird. You can't adjust angle. All ports are in backside, may be difficult to access them. Screen Quality is good. No cooling fan, system will heatup easily after a 30 mins use. Touchpad experience is not good. Though it is working, it is not comfortable. Screen to body ratio is high Good looking with good design. Amazon delivery is very good and package packing is also good."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-CR-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,"Fully satisfied with laptop. Bought it for online classes, net surfing and for my documents it does absolutely great work in all those areas. Surely not for gaming purpose. SSD drive makes it really fast in booting. Although it's processor is not so powerful therefore lag is visible when you go for heavy multitasking; CPU meter easily reaches 100. There is no fan in the bottom at times it even terrifies that overheating may not harm it internally. Screen is gorgeous therefore no issue with movie watching."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-CR-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,Boot in 22 seconds Word Excel and PPT works without any hassles Camera angle is fine. If we keep it in the table it's very good Light weight Teams and Telegram works fine Online video plays fine  Overall a value for money package

Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560492WIN9BE,laptop,"Very decent product from dell... I recommend this product only for modarate users, like office work, entertainment, business work, students work etc. Don't buy if you a heavy gamers. Otherwise overall nice performance... Butter smooth speed... And finally Intel i3 11th generation processor... So that it's battery just a big tram for this... You can easily get 5 to 6 hours battery life in continuous use or maybe more, Display is good... I wish it comes with 8 GB of RAM and backlit keyboard... Otherwise it is a monstar for performance... Sound is ok not so much loud... Camera is good.... Build with it plastic but I not to say it is best in class but you not disappointed...  Dell charging it quite premium I would say... But yes you have to remember that it's a brand... Otherwise it's a nice and decent laptop... (I wouldn't go in hardware details, it same as mentioned on paper, and expected performance for the same.)"
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560492WIN9BE,laptop,"Got the laptop delivered yesterday, a day later than promised by Amazon while ordering. Had to call Amazon Customer Service to check on the delay which, according to their email, was for ""operational reasons"". The laptop is fine so far, except for one disappointment. It does not have a DVD drive as claimed by the Amazon site. This needs to be corrected in the site so as to not mislead any customers for whom a DVD drive may be an essential feature in the laptop. Called Dell Tech Support for help with backing up the OS as well as creating a disk partition. They were very helpful. I could do it myself using their instructions, without any problem."

Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560492WIN9BE,laptop,This item Fully dead with in one week. Very poor service support
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560492WIN9BE,laptop,Laptop is good but there is no Disk Drive as shown in product description in website. When I tried to return the product; return and refund was promised from Amazon but Amazon employees are least cooperative while taking the return. Every time I call the customer service they give me a date for return pickup and no one comes to take the pickup and they say that the verification for return is failing and other reasons are given but the product is not taken back till now.
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560492WIN9BE,laptop,"Overall good!! I have purchased this laptop for my kid who is using online classes, but while zoom is opening for class after a few minutes it automatically get disconnected and memory alert coming not supporting 4GB RAM for zoom.

And lastly, i dont like its factory smell. When laptop heats up its smell increases."

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-10110U-Integrated-TP412FA-EC382TS,laptop,Totally satisfied. Display is very good. Touch functionality works very well. Stylus is bit laggy. Magnetic chip has not provided in the box. Sound quality is nice but low sound. Overall great product. I got the deal for ₹44500 😊
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-10110U-Integrated-TP412FA-EC382TS,laptop,"I'm so disapointed .After spending so much of money to get a laptop with this sort of camera is just pathetic ...with Work from home and study from home , camera is very important . this laptop's camera is the worst I have ever seen ...even the first mobile I had 10+ years back had a better camera...it's that bad. What surprises me that at this level,. How can a company like ASUS even allow such low grade camera to be part of this build...don't waste your hard earned money ...go for a DELL or a HP ..just horrible."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-10110U-Integrated-TP412FA-EC382TS,laptop,"Just wow! I gifted to my niece and she just loved it. Online education makes her easy now. She can spend time with this. Laptop smoothness is great. The Stylus, finger print, processor and everything makes its beauty. This is one of the fast machine for moderate use. I would recommend to all!"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-10110U-Integrated-TP412FA-EC382TS,laptop,"Like - lightweight compact, good for home use with win 10 and office 2019 preloaded. You can use it from the word go.  Dislike - 512GB SSD advertised in the product description. But when I received the laptop and while installing I found that it was 256 GB SSD hard disk. Very disappointing & misleading advertisement. Paid 46.5 K for 256GB, 10th generation I3 processor from a brand like asus is a ripoff. I needed this for my son's and yoga work, hence did not want to go through a complex return process and choosing another one after independence day sale is tiresome. This is not expected from Amazon. I feel cheated."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-10110U-Integrated-TP412FA-EC382TS,laptop,"Writing this review almost after a month got this laptop on july 27 for my younger sis for her digital art The battery life is good it can stay on till 7-8 hours for movies and listening music and for working almost 3-4 hours, the camera is okay and the microphone quality is good, speakers are not that loud the volume of the speakers is really very low you can barely hear what is playing on the laptop and for gaming this is not a gaming laptop so you cannot play any high end games the game would open but you will barely get 10-15 fps (frames per second). It also comes with a stylus which works fine. Not worth for gaming but for graphic designing worth it. Thank you!!"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-10110U-Integrated-TP412FA-EC382TS,laptop,It's apt for everyday use.. touch screen and keypad are smooth to operate and its sleek and light to carry around. Got it during Amazon sale for less than 45k.. absolutely worth it!

HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"NOTE : @ Its Available on other Online stores as well, so check before you purchase. @ This model don't have Touchscreen, so note that.  For using this device for couple of weeks, following are the observations from Normal User point of view. First I am mentioning the Specs and then I will explain the User Experience.  Following are the Specifications : ------------------------------------------ # Intel® Core™ i3-7020U processor # 1 TB storage, 4GB DDR-4 RAM # Integrated Intel 620 Graphics # 14 inch HD Display with Resolution 1366*768. # 3-cell (41WHR) battery & Windows 10 OS.  Following is the my user Experience :  BUILD-QUALITY :- ----------------------- # It has good build quality compared to price. # The top surface has matte finish and has good grip. # Speakers has good output. # It weighs around 1.5 KG, which is moderate weight considering the size. # Finally it looks good.  DISPLAY : ------------ # HD LED screen with a resolution of 1366*768 performs great. # Colours are Punchy. # Contrast is well above average. # Display performs well upto my expectations.  KEYBOARD & SPEAKERS : ------------------------------------ # Keyboard Doesn't have backlit. # Feedback from keyboard is good. # It Doesn't have a Numpad.  # Placement pf speakers are good, # Has Enough sound output. # Performance is above average.  BATTERY PERFORMANCE : -------------------------------------- # Its average performing battery. # With full charge I used to clock above 3 hours of battery backup. # It charges under 3 hours. # Even with Medium Brightness and heavy Multitasking, I used to get above 2 hours of backup. # So overall battery backup is below average.  SYSTEM PERFORMANCE : ------------------------------------ # I had NO problems while using this laptop for surfing and browsing internet. # Small and medium games also runs smoothly on it. # It Doesn't have fingerprint scanner. # Has 1x USB 2 and 2x USB 3 ports which are handy combination. # So to conclude its Average laptop.  VERDICT : ------------- Its a good device if the price would have being around 25k. UPS of this device is 7th gen processor, decent Storage and HP brand reliability. But apart from that there's hardly anything to attract. It lacks fingerprint sensor, Backlit keyboard, decent battery backup, better graphics and better display resolution. If there's a deal and if its available around 25k then go for it, else invest few thousand more and go for better device. For 30k its Not worth buying."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Best in looks, slim, light weight, display is awesome..... Performance as per specifications is good... It's a Beauty... Bought after so much research... Confused between Lenovo 330s and Dell latitude 14 inch series... It's much better than that.... Would recommend this.."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Overall pretty good package.... pros: Light weight.. Decent battery backup... Good looking smoke grey colour.. Good build quality... Cons: Inbuilt battery non removable Glossy display( mat display is good here it is glossy so reflection is there) Display quality is not uptomark Sound quality is average System is little laggy... Not that much
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Nice product for this range. This lappy is really awesome if u buy around 26K. I bought it in 22990₹. Actual price was : 25990₹ Instant discount applied from SBI card : 2000₹ Received 1000₹ in Amazon Pay Balance : 1000₹  Now Final price is 22990₹ (Great deal)
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I bought this laptop a month back during Amazon great indian festival. Been using it since then. The product is light weight, Sound is good, battery backup is good. But the important of all , the performance is horrible.  I've exchanged my 5 year old HP laptop with 3rd gen i5 processor. This has a 7th gen i3 processor & still it's not even half good as my old one.  The system lags , ALWAYS.  Takes a lot of time to process any operations.  I made a fresh install of windows 10 by created a recovery media & it's a bit better than how it used to be.  I realized this is a faulty product but i was late by that time. the last date for return has already completed 2 days before that. So now i'm stuck with this super slow laptop, No where to go..  and the worst thing.. RAM has only 1 slot with 4Gb, can't upgrade."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Please DO NOT buy UP product as I am stuck and wasted around 30K. System hangs every second and no support.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Purchased this Lappy for my Wife at the Amazon Sale for 23k after applying all discounts. I would say it is pretty good for the price. Looks sleek and slim, is light to carry around, screen display and sound is also good. Battery Life is pretty good at around 6+ Hrs. There is no fast charging though. As stated by others, performance is a slight issue. It is not fast or snappy and can take few seconds to launch apps. To get around it, i have added 4 GB Crucial 2400 RAM in Dual Channel and increased it to 8 GB. Though it is a challenge to remove the Back Cover to insert the RAM. HP has not made it end user friendly. Now, it responds better than before. Please do consider upgrading RAM to get around the slowness issue. Overall, it is a good laptop for doing basic tasks and light office work."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"This laptop has 7th generation i3 processor with 4gb ram and 1tb HDD, still from the first usage only I found that this laptop is 20 times slower than my 5 year old Pentium Lenovo laptop. Once you make the payment your payments also gets strucked with Amazon and also the policy is not at all customer friendly, they will not initiate refunds so that you can buy a new and different model if u want, you will have to settle down with the same model. I will be getting that same model again today, hope my 31000/- bucks does not go in drain as Amazon has confirmed that the 2nd product but same model will be working great. They said they will ensure this. I hope I don't have to go through the same pain and agony again."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Pathetic, as expected online not trustworthy"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Overall it's a nice package provided if you get it under 28k or 29k Sound quality is awesome , being a win10 os on 4gb ram lags sometime but that is manageable , looks good ,battery life is acceptable , a complete value for money buy given in this range . Competition is fierce in this range so choose according to your requirements mine was portability and in this area it aces given its dynamics and above all THANK U HP & AMAZON"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,This laptop has wasted my 15 days. I ordered then replaced and then again returned. As it takes too much time to boot. And I have not added in this laptop but its lagging too much. Finally second time i returned and ordered other brand. Pros. Battery back up good Charging time good. Cons. No backlit keyboard Lags too much Boot time more than 1 min. 30 seconds. Sometimes dont respond when goes to sleep mode.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,I bought the brand new laptopn but when it came it was locked by user and i found that the laptop was used by someone... amazon technician also visited and approved the same but nothing happened after that as well. What should I do now?
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I bought this Laptop couple of weeks ago primarily for my kid's online class, general browsing and basic MS office products usage. It is worth buying for these purpose. Audio is good, Camera is OK (could have been better) for online classes/meeting. Booting, Shut down and processing is fast/good. I am not sure on the performance for Gaming. MS Office Home and Student 2019 is pre-installed. Used Excel, Word and PPT for normal usage. It works fine. Battery life is decent. Key pad is OK. Draw back is its storage capacity. It comes with 256 GB, but usable is approx 237 GB out which around 50 GB (approx) is pre-loaded. So, around 180 GB will be available for our use. If there is a requirement for high volume storage, then this model is not recommended. You may have to buy additional 1TB / 2TB external hard disk for files storage."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Good
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I bought this laptop about 2 weeks back and used it twice yet. The speed is pathetic, I am not sure if this is an original HP product. Unfortunately the last date of return was yesterday, so not even able to return it now."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Combination does not work 4Gb Ram is pretty slow .I increased the Ram to 8 GB. Now is bit fine ,had place laptop decal / sticker coz it looks dull .. well for me I am happy with my purchase depends on your requirement .. Just increase your Ram max 2500/3000 with service charge will do your college or office stuff be smart and wise .."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Product is very nice and fast in working. Please allow Windows 10 to update fully while booting for the first time. It will roughly take about two hours on a high speed network and see after that it will go like anything. Really a good choice as per my headline.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,This laptop is good for office work only. Not recommended for performing heavy work like playing games and video editing work.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Laptop looks very compact and impressive(Build Quality). Performance is average, can’t complain as the ram is only 4GB. By default the colors in display looked washed out and dull, however you can make it vibrant by increasing the saturation levels (to 30) in intel HD graphic settings after which display looks amazing and vivid.  All in all a great buy at the given price point. Got it for 27500"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,As a budget laptop it does the absolute bare minimum.  Pros: Light enough to carry around. Decent battery life (3-4 hrs with normal usage) 1TB HDD allows for lots of storage  Cons: Very slow in booting (~3 mins to welcome screen) in spite of having Win 10. Very slow in running apps. Office applications take almost 20 secs to initialize fully. Reflective screen. Hard to see with light source behind you. Gets dirty easily Below average sound quality. Overpriced. Belongs in the 20k range
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,The product is one of the worst functioning laptop. The product just hanging and i3 processors performance is pathetic and cant run basic functions. Clearly a specification created by HP to be sold thru amazon so that the buyers are stuck with the maze of Amazon support and question and answers. We are sitting on 2 laptops that have been nonfunctional for more than a month. We tried return policy and now been told this cannot happen with amazon for these products. so clearly a con job by both amazon and HP as joint party.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Noisy fan. Requested for a replacement. The item was replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon for the prompt service though the replacement arrived a little late. Unfortunately the replacement has identified as defective (audio doesn't work). No Amazon is processing refund. In my experience this model is troublesome.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Very bad product. After 2 weeks it started giving display problem. Speed is super slow. Heating issues. One cant tolerate its speed of operating. Can not do anything on it within 2 months repaired it almost 3 4 times. Worst part is problem is still not solved. No one ready to take responsibility. Please do not buy. Waste of money and after that waste of energy to call them again n again.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"The laptop takes 2 minutes to boot up. If i want to run a program like chrome or even open a folder, the laptop takes ages to execute that command. Some software issue so i asked amazon for help. the technician comes over and takes a look at the laptop for 5 minutes and says its a software issue so they can't help. Approached hp customer care. They said its because the ram needs to be upgraded. Why would i need to upgrade the ram in a new laptop without any programs installed? The laptop has been lying like this since the past 6-7 months. Nobody can use it at the risk of going into depression."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"This laptop comes with original windows 10 and HP other utilities. Exactly after 1 year(after warranty expiration) the hard disk got corrupted which was identied by the HP diagnostic tool. But when I checked the harddrive in the other laptop it was running perfectly fine. Moreover, the laptop was not allowing me to install windows from Microsoft website giving boot error. You can only install only HP provided utilities and their diagnosic setup which is also paid. My 30,000 rupees went in drain as am very frustrated with their monopoly and would never buy HP laptop ever So I would request to go for some other brands like dell, sony, lenovo etc are better."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Everything is good about this laptop. Just one it is very slow. Although u can fix it by uninstalling the software on start up. Also I have purchased it on Amazon in great price 15,500 including exchange and cashback during great Indian festival. Also you gotta great battery life lasts for 7 hours easily. Also it has fast charger about 90 percent in 1.5 hours."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Sleek, slim and light weight laptop. A great deal.if you are looking for a laptop that can be carried around with ease. However, the performance is abysmal. But you can get rid of the problem by upgrading the RAM to atleast 8 GB ( expandable upto 16GB as per spec). Furthermore, you could add an SSD to improve the boot speed. I purchased this machine for running MATLAB, but struggled with the default 4 GB RAM. Added another 4GB ( Crucial) and now it works fine. Next plan is to add an SSD."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Fast delivery and the item is superb and genuine.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Using this laptop from last 10 months, Screen quality is very worst. Color calibration is very disturbed, And very poor built quality. Internal locks get detached, when try to open lid keybord and keybord cover comes out. Registered a call for support on 24 of sept and today 10 oct. Still complain not resolved by HP."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Worst product ..Never buy it...Looks like a fake product. And hp support is extremely poor. They never help. See the screen. Hardly been a month of buying and laptop throwing tantrums. Regretting my decision very badly.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,This is very low quality assemble. After 3 months ot started malfunctioning. I had to completely wipe out and reinstall the complete OS once. Still it is not in good condition. Too slow. Avoid buying with such low RAM which is mostly not compatible with windows 10. I would not recommend to buy this product unless it is for a student.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Too Down market product quality.. Laptop Body is made of too bad quality... Battery is too poor, Works only max 3 hours post full charging... Never expected this bad quality product from HP... Don't Buy this product, u will not have a feel that u hv purchased a new Laptop..."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Plz do not buy this product it hangs and processer s very slow looks like not original product. Pathatic laptop waste of money
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Chose this one for my sister. My first impression after opening the box was, how tiny and light weight this laptop is. Easy to hold and very convenient to carry. Talking about battert life, it's decent. I would say it would give you juice for around 3 to 4 hours( normal usage excluding games). Screen quality is also decent but not as immersive as those in higher end ones( don't expect great camera quality as it's below average) I would say after using the laptop and hearing no issues from my sister till now 😜I think this laptop is value for money laptop(NO EMI option is great /some bank discounts). I would definitely recommend this one who are looking for a decent looking and fast laptop. You can also add ssd card to fasten its processing and booting speed."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"The laptop display was corrupted within 2 days of usage. Apparently one of the rubbers in a corner was missing right from the time at was delivered. HP engineer noted this after inspection. Despite my best efforts to convince them that the laptop display I wasn't at fault, HP squarely put the blame upon me. It was such a sick and bad experience dealing with HP and their local service partner TVS electronics in Gurgaon. The folks there never answer your calls and close cases without giving a ear to what the customer is saying. I have dealt with Dell service (for a laptop purchased again on Amazon) and their service is far far better and professional."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"The laptop is quite slow. It is however quite light and can be easily carried. I feel that my earlier 8 year old laptop was better built. My review after 5 months.... Useless laptop. Freezes frequently. Very, very slow. Please dear Amazonians don't buy ! I am now using my old laptop. Sad, money down the drain. Long term review..... I am giving a Tip to speed it up....DISABLE WINDOWS AUTOMATIC UPDATES. INSTALL AN ANTI VIRUS. THE LAPTOP WORKS FINE NOW!"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Light weight is a definite plus. However, performance is very slow. I had to put an extra 4 GB RAM & a 250 GB SSD to make it bearable."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Slim and light. Looks very professional... little bit slow processing.. Average Camera.. Nice sounds quality.. Very slow and poor processing . Plz Don't buy it...
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Low in cost Not so heavy Ok ok look Good battery life Now comes to the performance part- main reason you are using a laptop not to just open and shutdown... but to do some work. They mentioned basic work. But what basic works. With my laptop, when you will start it, just bring one rope and hang yourself. You will get rebirth and then you come to use the laptop. Hope you get my point.  So one suggestion if you want to through your hard earned money then its ok. Otherwise go for a better model with higher price range."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"1. RAM is extremely low ,, had to increase it by 8GB to get a decent speed. 2. Screen started getting dead pixels in a years times, i didn't get it exchanged thinking would be ok. Pictured attached. 3. In less than 2 years i have a white screen. Can anyone suggest where can i get an original screen for a decent cost?"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Please do not buy, this laptop is internally slow! When I contacted customer, they made me do different things at first. But none helped, so they asked me to upgrade the RAM to 8GB. The worst part is that the customer care asked me to contact service center, and service center directed me back to them. I am sick and tired of this Ping Pong match. The customer care is worst that I have ever experienced. The service center said they will install the RAM but I need to but on my own, but nobody is telling me what to buy.... DO NOT BUY HP PRODUCTS!"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"UPDATE - THE LAPTOP IS NOW OF NO USE. THE TOUCHPAD IS NOT WORKING AND HEATING ISSUES. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP  When i received this laptop i was amazed how light it was and so compact. But when you boot the laptop for the first time you will know the truth. This laptop is very slow l, i mean very very slowif you are buying a Windows laptop you will get a good laptop above 30-40k only. This laptop being lightweight and so cheap is the reason that this is waste of money.  AMAZON CAN TURNED OFF COMMENTS ON THIS PRODUCT. SO YOU KNOW THE TRUTH NOW  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Best Laptop for light usage(Students), Not recommend for heavy gaming or Photoshops, firstly i got a faulty laptop (Fan not working),exchnged and got a New One.. Processor - Good Speed - Not that Great, But It works better with Windows 8 and it feels quite lag in W10 Ventilation - Fan vent. Is provided Below the Laptop (Very Bad) Price Point is Good"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Bought this last week. The only work I have is working on word documents and browsing. Even then, this laptop is sluggish at best. Windows 10 is not supported by a mere 4 GB RAM. So unless there is an option to enhance the RAM, this laptop is not worth it. As we say in hindi, 'Kaam Chalau'. I would rather spend few thounds extra and buy a better version.  Other features like battery and screen quality are good. The track pad is pretty tardy. Unworkable perhaps."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"This has speed issues. Laptop is extremely slow. Just added Google chrome after we bought this. Laptop start takes from 3-7 min. Anything you click, we need to wait for over 1 min for the action to reflect in screen. I feel the same way I started using the computer in late 90's. Never experienced such slowness in past decade. Total waste of money."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Ordered this product twice! Received faulty devices once, got it replaced. Ordered for the second time, and product stopped working after the return date had passed. Stuck with it now!"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"The product came i a good condition and on time. Gifted this to my father. The laptop is very lightweight and portable. The screen size is perfet for my dad. Battery life is decent and it performs the tasks of browsing and running some applications simultaneously quite decently. It's perfect for my dad's usage. Power users might want to see somewhere else. Windows 10 experience is good. My dad is happy, so I am happy."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Cons :Performance is slow with 4gb ram requires either SSD or Ram upgrade to perform better. Very slow performance for even students and specially not recommended for work from home/office usage.  Pros: It's Hp, Genuine windows 10, MS office home & student 2019, Alexa inbuilt app pre-installed.  My experience after 3 days of usage."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Not at all meeting expectations, I still have my 5-year old Lenovo which performs better than this one... It keeps getting frozen at everything... has some major issues, especially for a brand new laptop, that too for a brand like HP & I haven't even installed anything big or major to slow it down soo much & it's only a few months old... I'm searching for my warranty information to return or get it replaced... I'm regretting choosing this over Lenovo bcuz I was getting a good deal, or so I thought..."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Product rating 3.5. Ok, so I am writing this review after using this product for over a month. There are lot of reviews about this product on the web and even on Amazon, so there is a high possibility of creating a lot of confusion. Note below points and if you are ok, then buy this product without any second thought: 1. Win 10 64 bit+ 4 gb Ram + i3 7th Generation, all this together won't provide you very great performance in any brand. 2. Still, you will get a decent performance for browsing, using any softwares or even playing mid range games. 3.If you go on to upgrade the Ram, things will work pretty well. 4. HP comes with lot of preloaded softwares that will create a lag for the initial experience of around 15 mins for using the laptop. But after that everything works fine. 5. It is pretty light weight and well built which enables it to carry around with ease."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,I suggest to spend some more funds and buy laptop with better processor
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,World worst laptop ever.  Dont buy HP products.  If you think you can do away with slow laptops and buy this. being slow is not its only character.  The wifi will not work. The network adaptor will fail. it will drain happiness from your life and make you sick.  Pice of junk. Better throw your 30 K into an old well.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Price should be less and you will need a ssd and system will feel slow untill you format and reinstall windows.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I feel sorry for Amazon for not ensuring the right product! Actually what I received might be a duplicate... The pre installed OS not working properly. I uninstalled it. Also, it doesn't has a barcode and nothing else and it made be high subspecies about its genuiness!  Trust me 100% and avoid to buying it!"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Using for a year now. The laptop is good but is too slow at times. Especially while using Chrome. Had to reduce a few of Win 10 features to increase its speed. Advice: Avoid buying Win10 with i3. Go for i5. Also prefer 8 GB RAM. If you could get OS installed in ssd then it's the best. This laptop is fine for light works and kids. Not for heavy official work.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,This laptop is useless if u don't upgrade RAM and SSD. But once u do that it works like charm. Its compact and looks professional. The Battery LIfe is as best as u can get. Easily gives you 8hrs with moderate usage. wl give even 12hrs if not used continuously. The screen is just HD not FHD so its okay okay... overall if u spend another 3k for ram and ssd then its quiet usable.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"The laptop received was faulty, I am following up like a crazy."

Now m unable to understand what to do to replace this laptop as my job work is in halt and I am loosing 5000rs per day due to this laptop inefficiency , pls suggest who will bear this loss??

HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"We bought this for our office use. The general usage is only in excel, word and mails. Even for this activity, the system is dead slow. It switches off quite often. We did not expect this quality from reputed manufacturer like HP. We are disappointed.  After submitting this response on 3rd July, not a single response from HP. This shows their careless attitude for defective model. I used to always buy HP product for personal use and official use. This attitude will change my mind and will not take HP at face value. Again disappointed."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Poor display damaging eyes. What's the use of a laptop with worst screen???? It's as good as cheating users without highlighting the trouble within this model. They are trying to trick & sell you this very very very poor product. STAY AWAY.

HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Problem in operating. System is very very slow from day one. HP customer care is also unable to repair it. System is if no use if issue is not resolved. Overall very poor performance.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Don't buy, seems hardware is not compatible with software. Takes almost 15 to be able to be able to start some work. Basic Excel or powerpoint keeps on hanging/freeze. Wish I could return this. Don't waste your money"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"System unable to handle windows 10. Adding linux made it marginally faster, but the hard disk has crashed in under 2 years of usage. Even formatting and reinstalling os is not helping. Never seen something like this."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,It is really slow to operate. Handle handle more than 2 applications at a time. Hangs frequently. Add some more money and buy ssd and higher configuration. This is waste of money.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Best size and colour. I really like it. I am still using it, nothing defect yet. But Just for home use only. You can go for a better one.  I got this product with 25000. It's the cheapest price I ever bought. So value for it's price is excellent. So if you get it for this price, don't wait a second ""use your dad's account.""😉"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"For my home requirements, this fits the bill. Battery life is good and the laptop IS lightweight. Screen is reasonably ok. I’m not into gaming and, therefore, cannot comment on the processing speed. Overall good value for money"

I did cleaned up the temp files and stuffs but still no help. Looks, weight all are okay but if it can't serves it's actual purpose then what is the use of it? I am going to take it to a service center and get it checked anyway."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,First laptop had hardware issues and got the replacement ... Again for the new one key board spacebar not working..Spot on screen can be seen.. one of the worst product from HP.. I'm using HP devices since 2009 but never had this kind of experience!!!
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I had gifted it to my mother and saw the laptop for the first time only after 8 months. Very very slow processing speed. It's slower than my older laptop which was bought 10 years ago. I believe the sellers seems to be doing some malpractice, better to stay away from this seller."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,I purchased this for home use. Usage was very limited. After some time I realized that top plate is separated from the plastic body. The hinge is pretty stiff compared to other laptops and puts a lot of pressure on the nuts holding the screws. Overall build quality is poor. Unfortunately this happens just after a year.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I have paid decent amount of money for this laptop. its compact and light. Only concern about the ram management, I feel like 4GB is not enough for the smooth performance. On offline mode its ok with 4GB RAM. however I have expanded to 8GB RAM and now its pretty much smooth. please not I won't recommend for the gammers."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Well built, fast and durable laptop. Got this for 23K. No regrets. Best laptop in this category. Light weight. Thanks seller and Amazon for the deal"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I needed laptop only for browsing purpose, it was mentioned that it's fit for that. However, it is very slow and is not fit for anything. It is better that you put in more money and buy better laptop for browsing rather than this junk"

HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,ThIs laptop is bogus. Don't be fooled by the low price and loaded windows. The laptop though lightweight is highly bloated with pre built software's and the moment you switch on you will see the disk space is 100% consumed and 80%memory is consumed.. I bought this laptop one week to install some bi tools and boy I am super disappointed..
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Dead after 2 Days, very disappointed."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Bought this for my wife as a replacement for my 9 year old Dell. I am a mac user and use windows at work. The build quality is good and i got it for 27k. For this price an HP light weight laptop is a steal though miss a back lit like the mac but except for that the product is good. Will write another long term review later.

You can buy, but believe me, you will regret. Rest, you wish."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,Honestly saying it was a gift to my sister who is studying in another city. The laptop worked for 1 month and then its screen got affected and keyboard didnt worked. Faced mamy issues while going for a warranty. Still the laptop is a waste.

HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Budget laptop, average build quality, 4gb is insufficient for Win10, upgraded to 8gb, works smooth now. Light weight.good for browsing, documenting, etc. For medium to heavy usage, It's better to invest another 10k and go for i5 and 8gb configuration minimum."
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,This combination of hardware and Windows 10 is deadly. Laptop becomes super slow with installing elementary soft wares. Forget about professionals can't even handle classes of a junior school student.
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,i bought it for twenty six thousand and got two thousand rupees back on amazon pay. i was happy enough to get it dirt cheap but the happiness doesn't lasted it for much time. this laptop will really test your patience if you are using it for multi functions. rest all is good. if you are using chrome then use only chrome and nothing else.

But only thing I done get is why having 4gb ram and i3 processor wid genuine windows 10 this laptop is slow. It's booting time is slow. I researched and found that there is no problem from dealer and Amazon s side .I think it's something from HP company as they have added some extra or can say unnecessary software preloaded wid this laptop. If anyone knows what to keep and what to uninstall pls comment below so that it can be helpful for others. Otherwise this laptop is very good."

HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"I wrote this review just to inform you guys who complained it being slow, laggy, freezing, hanging etc. - simply add 4/8 Gb RAM to it. Windows 10 needs MORE THAN 4 Gb to run smoothly. All those who say 4gb is enough for windows 10 are talking crap and knows nothing. It has an extra RAM slot. I have added 8gb RAM . So now my machine has 12 Gb RAM (4 + 8) . Its now blazing fast, as if my sick donkey has Been converted into an Arabian Stallion !!"
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"This laptop is a great choice for portable general purpose usage. But get rid of the seagate hdd that comes with it and fresh install win 10 in an ssd. The seagate hdd that is coming in this laptop is the base model 5400 rpm 1Tb model that is not suitable for running the os. Display is great even though it is not IPS panel. WD green or Kingston 240 Gb SSD is enough to make the laptop look fast. If you can throw away some extra pennies, definitely samsung 860 EVO is the way to go."

Its a trick to get you stuck onto these fake machines. The second machine arrived and again it was slow as hell. I tried everything from upgrading windows updates from microsoft to installing a fresh anti virus, nothing works. A desktop from 2000's will be faster than these machines. Last month out of frustration i bought a new laptop from retail store Lenovo. Will never buy HP ever again or any electronics from amazon.The slow issue has not been resolved.

HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,As expected hp quality.. light weight. Due to the preinstalled OS performance but slow.. uninstall bloated software if it useful or if you install other OS top of that you can feel actual speed of the system
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,If the word SLOW = frustrating.. then only buy this laptop. HDD crashed in first month. New HDD replaced and new Win10 install also done. You can cook small dinner before things move. Unless you boost Ram and shift to SSD
HP-Graphics-14-inch-Windows-14s-dq2100TU,laptop,"Giving one star is also not appropriate.just believe me nothing can be an ideal way to waste ur money than purchasing it. Plus amazon has lots of ideas to fool the customers.  They don't stick to their own words.  Happiness is just not guaranteed.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Warranty-82H801CUIN,laptop,"Deliver: Very sharp  Product: I needed a laptop which a quite good configuration to suit the current trend. Of course I wasn't aiming for too high configuration or rather I put it in this was, I was looking for a laptop with in 40 to 60 K range. I have cornered Lenovo and choose few Dell and HP laptops with SSD specifically. Lenovo slim 3 suddenly stuck me and I did go through some videos on Youtube. I must say that the guy should have been drunk while he shot that video about this laptop. This laptop looks exactly like a China toy. What promises which the look is exactly the opposite. Body is plastic and not good at all. Camera is awful. This is the worst camera I have ever had come across. Screen is just bright and color is so dull. Battery drains out fast. Its not a promising laptop.  Long story short-- Do not buy this laptop. Its garbage"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Warranty-82H801CUIN,laptop,"Overall good configuration for the given price. Look wise nice and neat finishing. Processing time is faster, booting is quite fast. Need to check once required software are loaded. Reason for lower rating - Not happy with color contrast and whiteness used/provided. Pictures and video looks bit dull. I have higher end Lenovo and compared to that this is having low quality on screen output. Rest is good, yet to explore more."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Warranty-82H801CUIN,laptop,"Guys, don’t buy laptops and such gadgets from Amazon, you will be let down by their partners. I waited for 3 days for the delivery, I had purchased the new laptop on an exchange. The delivery person started pointing out all insignificant issues with the old laptop, which was in a perfect working condition, and cancelled the order in abruptly, they mentioned the reason that the old laptop doesn’t meet the exchange criteria, whereas no such thing was mentioned on Amazon. This left a very bad taste of customer experience."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Warranty-82H801CUIN,laptop,"Very slow configuration, automatic system restarts , no inbuilt msoffice , display quality poor ,not so worthy. Overall bad product"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Warranty-82H801CUIN,laptop,Received no display Laptop. Return process is also not up to mark. Delivery agent deny to to pick up so many time because screen is not working even if I have mention screen issue clearly.

Acer-Graphics-Keyboard-15-6-inch-A515-56,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The Laptop did not start initially. Later when I managed to start and set things up it proved to be an extremely slow laptop. Not only that the many a times it is crashing and restarting. One should never buy this product. Seems my 50k went down in drain.
Acer-Graphics-Keyboard-15-6-inch-A515-56,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The only reason I bought it as is is the 11th gen i5 1135g7 Chip . It came with 1TB HDD and 8 Gb Ram , and was painstakingly slow out of the box , it was really bad . To complete the setup for windows 10 it took 1 hour , even after that , the laptop was not smooth it would lag constantly due to the HDD being the bottleneck it would hang a lot and even basic tasks like web browsing were choppy and irritating especially for a new 11th gen i5 laptop in 2021 , it felt like an old 5th gen i5 with the HDD . To anyone looking to buy this , basic requirement would be an ssd . Get an Samsung 980 m.2 base variant , then the laptop come to life , as if a load had been lifted from its very soul . With that SDD , it is fast , smooth , and feels like an 11th gen laptop . Ram -- 4gb Solderd to MoBo , 4gb removable (Upgradable to 16gb stick ) Strangely it Does not support display out over Type-C or even type-C charging , which is Surprising as even the AVITA Liber V14 series which is a whole 15k cheaper than this supports display out and type-C charging . I have to return this though as was facing wierd screen glitches and ghosting (See video) . Battery life is bad , around 2-3 hours maxx . DO NOT Expect More than that . Also Screen, Keyboard and all are pretty mediocre , nothing to write home about . Overall good , but not usable without a SSD"
Acer-Graphics-Keyboard-15-6-inch-A515-56,laptop,Product has false description mentioned on technical detail section. They says the product has 4.2Ghz of processor speed but the one I received is of 2.4GHz. Worst customer support from Amazon.
Acer-Graphics-Keyboard-15-6-inch-A515-56,laptop,"Thin, Silver colure, Excellent laptop. I5 processor in low budget is very good. It is very light laptop. If you need it for office use or school use its very good. It is very fast. Using this laptop since 1 month but i have no problem. Amazon is Excellent it replaced the earlier brought laptop as the charger was heating. Great response. Dont see negative review they were also mislead me."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"I received this laptop on 21st April 2021 and i am writing this review after a week's usage. I will break this down into 3 parts which are: 1) Specifications 2) Real World Performance! 3) For whom is it?  =>Specifications: How it looks on paper? AMD Ryzen5 5500U built on 7nm technology is a beast and can run through anything you throw at it. It has 6 cores and 12 threads and they are decently clocked. GPU present is AMD Radeon integrated graphics. It comes with 8GB (Micron Technology 3200MHz) SODIMM RAM and out of that 512MB is allocated to VRAM. You can increase the RAM up to 16GB in future with both RAM’s working in dual channel mode. It has PCI Express 4.0 and 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD. For other hardware info: https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c07119618 Now if you look at these specs it is definitely a steal deal. No other laptop company is giving you these specs at this cost in India. [₹50,990]  =>Real World Use: What things matter in day to day usage? 1) Boot time: Try to spell the laptop name along with the model number and it will be up and running. For me it was always less than 20 seconds. 2) Battery Life: Normal usage – 6 hours, Intensive usage – 3 hours (These generally vary on what you have installed on your laptop and background processes) 3) Multitasking: It can handle your tasks easily and most of the times it will be a cruising experience. 4) Display: Here it depends on an individual’s priority. It has a BrightView (glossy) display with 250 nits brightness which is decent for indoor use but it will struggle under sunlight. So, you can either use an anti-glare screen guard for your purpose or make a compromise because of the price. 5) Gaming: It can handle casual gaming very well. I played FIFA 19 for a while at low settings and never once it suffered a frame loss. Will update it with more games and cofigurations. 6) Portability: It weighs around 1.4 kilograms and is easy to carry around. 7) Build Quality: I would say since its lightweight+14inch so a little compromise on build quality should not be a concern. It looks like it’s made of hard plastic but maybe here and there HP might have used some aluminium (or any other alloy). Sometimes when you lift the laptop with a single hand it produces a faint creaking sound. Feels like it’s due to hard plastic but can’t ask more at this price point. 8) Ease of Use: It comes with Microsoft office Home and Student 2019, HP Support Assistant, HP PC Hardware Diagnostics & Alexa for romance(lol). So, this gives you a very good platform to work on without any hiccups and still if it’s there (Same old Linux vs Windows thing) then you have enough tools to deal with it. 9) HP Hinge: No one talks about it so I brought this up. Most of the HP laptops faced this issue 3-4 years back but now I think its alright. I regularly use HP Zbook as my office laptop and I think this laptop uses the same type of hinge (quality difference is definitely there but Zbook is expensive too). Hinge is not too tight but Ok’ish tight. 10) Speakers: They are not adequately loud but produce clear sound with a decent base. If you are using it casually to watch movies/videos in a not so loud room then it will be fine. Dedicated Bluetooth speakers are definitely going to outperform the budget segment laptop speakers. Personal suggestion is to buy one if you are willing to use this laptop to watch movies/videos in a group. 11) Heating: Whatever work I have done in last 7 days I did not face any overheating issues (AMD processors are doing a good job here). Fan is silent most of the times. Only when you are running intensive tasks you can hear them gushing air out of the laptop’s fan vent. 12) Keyboard: It has a laptop sized backlit chiclet keyboard with two levels of brightness control for the light. Again, I would say it depends on one’s preference and budget. 13) Connectivity: It has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2. For day to day use its Ok but not seamless. I faced some speed drop while being connected to both. When I disconnected the Bluetooth, it was back to normal. I still need to confirm it with other users. 14) Zoom/Teams/Skype calls: Haven’t tested the video on live calls which very much depends on how good your internet connectivity is but it has a good camera setup. It is missing physical camera shutter but that’s fine with me. 15) Trackpad is not that great but it gets the work done. It would have been better if it had two click buttons. It supports multi touch and gestures. 16) After Sales Service: HP has one of the best after sales service so it has to be mentioned. It’s always a plus point.  Overall, it is a great laptop and is performing better than what I expected. I tried to keep all relevant points and these points may be updated in future after a long-term use. Do let me know if I missed anything. P.S.: No unboxing video was made by me 😜 Just a neutral review with no promotions for either party.  =>Is this laptop for you? This is a very subjective question and its answer depends on how you are going to use the laptop. In short here are my views: 1) College Students: Considering the fact they need to run various simulation/modelling software along with an added benefit of portability it’s a good option for them. This laptop would be able to handle all of that. 2) Business Professionals: Its portability will attract you but if you are looking for durability too, I would suggest you to wait a little and see if there are alternatives. Its not a laptop like ThinkPad which can also be used to play cricket. 3) Content Creators: Your first choice would be Apple’s M1 powered devices but if you are on a budget then there is no other laptop near 50K who can compete with them on paper. It has 6 cores and 7nm tech whereas M1 has 8 cores and 5nm tech but the price difference is huge. I know it’s a wrong comparison but still it shows the power of this processor. I would encourage you to get one more 8GB RAM stick at the time of purchase only. 4) SDE’s/ML Engineers/Data Scientists: It’s a good laptop for you too. It has expandable RAM capacity and a good processor. It would be able to handle data manipulation, cleaning, etc. well and can run popular software with ease. For those doing intensive tasks like deep learning where high end GPUs are suited, they should definitely give this a rethink. But for that too we have alternatives by using cloud-based processing/computing power. Beginners can manage with 8GB RAM but later on you would need to increase it to 16GB. 5) Others: If you don’t need much computation power then go for cheaper laptops, they would also be able to manage your day to day tasks. HP 14s fq1029au is an excellent choice for you.  So ending this with just one conclusion….you will not get a better laptop under 51K at this time."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The top cover is very bad. It's cracking.The screen backside is cracking by itself. Not sure why with less than two months I am facing this issue. The system works well still the outer cover is cracking. Please see the pictures. Kindly let me know what to do? Can you do a exchange or help me in replacing the screen cover?
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,I don’t have a review about the product. It’s about the seller. On the backside of the laptop one screw is tampered. It’s like someone struggled and opened it. I didn’t notice it first. I opened the laptop and checked the warranty. Warranty started on April and I bought the laptop on May. I doubt that someone opened the lap and replaced something. Saddest part is that this delivery was fulfilled by Amazon. The retailer was VTM_SLP. I think the laptop is good but never buy it from this retailer. And if Amazon.in or hp cares about their reputation; blacklist this seller.
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Bought it for Rs. 50,990. Pros: 1. Excellent sound. Loud clear with decent bass. Did not expect this. 2. Really good display. Decent peak brightness. Excellent viewing angles. 3. Decent webcam. Better than expected. 4. No heating issues. At full power option, kept only warm. 5. Good battery. I guess on normal workload (word, excel, youtube, browsing), you can expect around 7 hours easily. 6. Good feedback on the keyboard. Good travel distance. 7. Has backlit keyboard. 8. Speedy ssd drive and powerful processor. 9. MS office 2019 bundled for free. 10. Trackpad does the job. Has multigesture support.  Cons: 1. Looks and colour (subjective). Doesn't feel premium and silver isn't really a good choice. 2. Heavier than i expected. Not sleek.  Haven't stress tested the laptop yet. Didn't test graphics. Overall verdict - unless you want to wait for Zen 3 ryzen processors (remember 5500u is 5000 series but is based on Zen2, not Zen3), choose this without hesitation."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Great product with AMD Ryzen 5 5500u. 8gb ram with one empty slot and dual channel support. 512 gb NVMe M.2 ssd upgradeable upto 2 tb. 2 stage Backlit keyboard, glossy screen, great 65w charger, good variety of ports, good for programming and browsing and multitasking. Comes with pre lodaed win 10 and office 365 with life time lisence. Overall best for programming and day to day working. Because I bought it only for programming. At these price range one can blindly buy it."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"This product is really great. Ryzen 5 5500u is better than i5 11 gen. 6 core 12 threads.

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Packaging is very good and safe and Only good thing in this laptop is Processor is latest and efficient I observed some cons in this laptop are: Not anti glare display Speaker Sound feels low sometimes Battery charging takes nearly 2 hours for full charge inspite of having 65 watts fast charger. Battery life is around 4-5 hours on normal usage.  Pros: Efficient processor 5500u fast processing Back lit keyboard Very easy to handle ,light weight and portable  Main points to consider while buying this laptop are: They installed Hynix 512GB SSD Which is of average quality when compare with Samsung and some other brands. 8 gb Ram is of micron company"
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"*First read all points after pressing the buy now tab. 1. Many users are telling in reviews that ""This product is broken, damaged ,opened, software issues, warranty started one month before , Invoice , (Serial no.) not given in invoice etc. Ans. First of all , after buying any product from Amazon or any online platform .SEARCH first for verified sellers of any brand product on their product Website . ie. Ihave searched Hp website after buying this laptop where i found that the only seller (Appario retail pvt.ltd) is showing as a verified , because 1000 of fraud sellers are Roaming in all online platforms. *Imp> 1. If you got some other SSD in place of SAMSUNG then you are ripped. Because in this model (14s fq1030au and 14s 1029au ) hp company is providing samsung ssd. 2. if you haven't got any invoice or poduct serial no. in Invoice , then you are buyed from unverified seller. (they can replace anything in product because HP company dosen't sells them product directly and they won't take their service as their responsibility. 3. IN MY BUYING EXPERIENCE > *product is well packed, no any damage. * Proper invoice with serial no. is given. *Display is IPS and glossy (not anti-glare). *tiny screen bleeding in left bottom screen (as normal to all laptops). *sound is not loud but very clear voice that makes feel premium. *Use all laptops on table or at solid surface instead of using on bed etc ,For better ventilation. *I'VE brought it from appario retail pvt.ltd. *Very good and sleemless performance. *Body is made up of plastic but of premium quality.  ** Brought it for 50990/- * If your budget is 50-52k last then buy it without any hesitation .  ***THANKS ALL**"

I called so many times to HP support center , mail sent and whats app message also but still there is no positive response. I never expect this type customer service from HP (Well known brand value).  So i am writing this post because i still have hope that someone will help me and solve my problem.  Thanks"
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"I usually don’t write reviews but this is such a steal for 51k, just go for it. Obviously try if you can get it offline first but if not, Amazon is great. Although YouTube reviews said the Bluetooth and wifi are older versions, they work absolutely fine with my new gen devices too. Boot time initially is 6 seconds then after some changes and app installation 8-9 secs.  •Ryzen 5 at this price is just wow •Body + looks are amazing and sleek •You get MS office •SSD is great and fast overall •The speakers omg amazing  It’s amazing 💜 I’m happy with the purchase Do get a wireless mouse for a better experience"

The speaker sound clarity and camera is decent and sufficient for the classes. Boots up quickly. As of now, battery goes down to 40 to 50% from a full charge after 3 classes of 45 minutes each.

Love this product ❤️ it has a good battery life,and because of the SSD it is very fast🔥 I used it on the minimum brightness and with the keyboard backlight off then it gave me around 7-8 hours battery life .

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"First time laptop user.. I feel like I bought a flagship laptop.😄 Battery backup is good 2 day on normal usage(like zoom meetings,media consumptions, I don't play games so I don't know about that)  Display is awesome eventhough IPS LCD it looks richer there are deep blacks which make me more addicting to display. And webcam is moderate it's not that good in room lighting. Yeah,there is no anti glare coating but it doesn't bother my view I can clear ly view in any lighting if it disturb means I probably change my position. Haha that portability is what main thing of a laptop😜  Personally kinda like this design simple and sleek. Touchpad is so smooth. Backlit keyboard is awesome and it's pleasing for typing too.  Processor Is beast.. ryzen 5 5500u at 42k. Boot time is hardly 3 seconds.. no slutter no lag.. good video and photo rendering.. I didn't see any heating issues And hey it is windows 11 compatible. Go for it."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Nice range laptop under 51000k. Some cons : 1)laptop panel is little loose due to which side panels keeps moving while u sit under full fan # like Avita laptops 2) Adaptor gets more heat while charging due to which laptop gets heated 3) keeping laptop on bed or cushion/pillow gets heated from backside -dont know why ! 4) now a days hp support are too slow , raise a complain for change of adaptor more than 5 days over still no calls. 5)Rest is all okay, small things matters alot while buying.

But still i wanted to open up one thing honestly. 1.Heating is there (which I already know before purchasing,since its a lightweight model). Gaming Laptops are the beast in all sectors,but I can't think of a model with weight.I prefer lightweight ones,even if I have to sacrifice gaming.Hence i chose this and im happy with my daily tasks like editing,coding etc"
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"I've had a good experience with this, it's fast, glossy screen doesn't bother much thanks to appario (seller) and amazon for safe delivery and packing...

No Nvidia card (can't expect at 51k also but...) Thanks to hp for this model at this price This is the best laptop I've found after months of research in 50 price range, you can go for it....  Thanks for reading Edit after 1.5 months: there's small sound when I tap on touchpad, unlike my friends laptops, but its not a big issue at all, as I bought it for 51k...."

Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,Overall awesome
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Awesome performance! I did a little bit of light gaming by playing valorant and it runs perfectly, no performance issue observed. High-end software such as matlab runs perfectly without any slow down. Battery life is good. I was able to use it for about 4.5-5 hrs even while running multiple applications together, some casual while others more performance oriented. Display is not anti-glare, so not suitable to use in sunlight. However, viewing angle is decently broad (about 150 degress). It has WiFi 5, however, there are no problems in connectivity. Although I find the camera quality slightly below average, but it's a reasonable compromise for its price (bought it for INR 51k)  College students can certainly consider this for a budget laptop with good performance and portability."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,HP SUPPORT IS PATHETIC. YOU CAN NOT EVEN FIND THEIR CALL CENTER NUMBER.. SOMEHOW IF U GET IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR SUPPORT MODEL... DON'T THINK THAT IF U CALL THEM AND UR ISSUE RESOLVED. HARD THINK IS TO LAUNCH UR COMPLAINT.. I STRONGLY SUGGEST NOT TO GO WITH HP PRODUCTS. avoid it. Also this model is not value for money... its actual best buy cost is 42k..but just Due to shortage price is inflated.. go for lenevo like brand.
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"I have used this laptop for more than 2 months now, and personally haven't faced any issues at all. The display despite missing anti glare is decent. Speakers are great and the best part is the CPU performance, Ryzen 5500u coupled with 8 GB RAM slaps! Looks pretty good but doesn't feel very sturdy so use it with caution and care, another small negative is the touchpad, design wise feels a little awkward to me. Other than that, my requirements as a Student are more than satisfied. I am very happy with my purchase, would highly recommend it to anyone."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,I bought many laptops with HDD with intel processors in the past and was expecting a laptop to be fast and cool so I decided to buy a Ryzen with ssd but this really disheartened as it is heating too much even without installing a single software yet. I asked Amazon for replacement
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,The performance is good... Sleek & Stylish; hands down! But it got hanged multiple times while making and reviewing some videos. Surprised! AMD is known for its high GPU capacity. Using it for the last 3 months...
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,Keyboard lights not working.
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Good screen, clear and loud sound. Best is we get a backlit keyboard which is not mentioned in the description. Best laptop in this price."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Firstly, Amazon service is great. My Laptop got delivered within 24 hrs. You will get amazed by the look. After one week of usage, I must say that, this laptop is worth to buy. Processor Ryzen 5 is superfast. NVME SSD makes it even more faster. Display is awesome. Backlit keyboard is also looks cool. It is lighter in weight. So, you can carry it anywhere. Camera can be better but still it is good. Battery gets fully charged within 2 hours (If you have 15% before charging). Also, it lasts for a complete day. So, nothing to worry. As I am not a gamer. So, this review is based on my experience as a programmer who works in IT industry."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Bought this for Personal Coding using Visual Studio, VS Code and SSMS all works smoothly.

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,In this prize range it is best laptop. All features is good but in this laptop display is not anti glare which is disapointed me. Battery performance is good .processor is excellent.i think this is best laptop and y should go with.....
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,battery last 6 - 7 hrs on battery save mode with half brightness. But only last 1-2hrs on performance mode. Ryzen 5 5500u is best at this this price point if you mant more processing power go for ryzen 7 5700u. diplay is good build quality is not that good. there are some small panel gaps. i was going to buy lenovo thinkpad e14 gen 2 amd but its has poor screen quality so i bought this. ms office life time validity and i also got 100gb of dropbox for 12 months. very portable and lightwieght. overall rating 4/5
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Cheapest, efficient and reliable laptop to have. It has really beaten IdeaPad and best configuration in this range. Couldn't have asked for better.

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,It's very slow in its processing.
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"I use this product for coding. It's light and fast, only thing I am concerned about regarding this product is durability, although it has a aluminium body its not strong and it should he handled with care.  Screen is good its an led display Speaker system is also good.  You can definitely go for this product if you want to code or do some office work  It's definitely not for gaming purposes."

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"I purchased the device on 22nd June and got it on 24th June. The warranty of this device had already started from 25th May. The fan makes noise while running common apps like Chrome, Outlook etc. Also the area near vents is relatively hot. All this without running heavy apps. Not sure if the product I received is genuine."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,In product description it is mentioned anti-glare display. But the product screen is super reflective. Didnt expect this from amazon.

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Don't buy this laptop at 54,000 because this is available in 50,000 on 15 days agooo wait until price low"
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Got this laptop with another amazon account. Delivery was no hassle, on time. PROS: - This laptop has very snappy performance because of the Ryzen 5 - 5500U processor. Far ahead of any generic mid-range Intel processor in real world usage. - 512 SSD is the new standard - don't buy anything below this. Definitely not a normal HDD anymore. - Full versions of Office bundled with the laptop - Screen is glossy but bright and usable. Full HD - Sound is a pleasant surprise - crisp and loud, perfect for that occasional youtube video or online classes  CONS - Keyboard is a bit shallow but you'll get used to it. The keys are widely spaced and large so that's good. - Silver color is not really my preference but that's subjective - Battery life is average but I didn't expect anything super long either and neither should you at this price - Screen is glossy - both a pro and con. I just fixed a matt screen protector and a keyboard silicone cover - There is some amount of typical HP bloatware but you can get that removed.  50k laptops are usually a compromise of too many things and they manage to underwhelm you in almost all areas. To think people buy a 50k phone these days and replace within 2 years, this will last you atleast 3 to 5 years in my view.  BOTTOM LINE: This one is GREAT price vs. performance - I'll buy it again without a second thought."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,Good beast performance Light weight But no rj45 port No wifi6 Good looking no issues Good display and sound Value for money
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Price is more than the value, where 15.6 inch got 48990.. This is not valuable price for 14 inch laptop.."
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,Battery life is great. Colours are nice. No screen bleeding. Backlit is superb. Multitasking is better than i5 .Jst go for it . windows 11 is supported. Wifi and Bluetooth version are the old one but didn't cause any problem. Network speed was superb. If ur budget is 50k then definitely go for it . Overall best product at this range . Only thing is that buy from appario retail it is genuine. By the way I bought from reliance digital at 49500. U can check in reliance digital site it stocks up every alternate dates. Thank u 😏 Upvote
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"I have purchased this fq1030au model laptop from hp authorised dealer, and it's mind blowing purchase, it's screen quality, battery life, multiple tasking, processing, backlit keyboard is awesome.

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,"Great laptop. Worth buying Disappointing ALEXA😤 Cons: Bad camera Screen is not that great.( since I have been using my phones amoled I guess) Pros: Battery (5 to 6 hrs standby for normal use and 4 hrs standby for heavy use) Thin and light.

HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,If you have budget around 50-55k buy this laptop. I am personally using this for coding. Keyboard light is useful. Boot up and shut down speed is best. Go for ryzen 5 5500u blindly.
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,Anyone facing battery issue? Battery stuck at 99 percent? Can anyone drop text. I exchanged 2 laptops both faced same
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,OVERALL LAPTOP IS GREAT DISPLAY IS GREAT PERFORMANCE IS GREAT SOUND IS GREAT GAMING IS GOOD ACCORDING TO ITS SPECIFICATIONS BATTERY IS AWESOME FOR NORMAL USE I USED IT FOR 6 HOURS FROM 99 TO 30 AND (STILL 30 LEFT GUYS) BUT I FOUND ONE PROBLEM ITS BATTERY GETS STUCK AT 99% IDK WHY .WHAT SHOULD I DO?
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,It would be better if it had antiglare display Good price. The battery is good it has been 3 days I have been using it I'll come back to update more things about it
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,It's a budget laptop . I have purchased it at 49.5k . If you need a multicore performance then definitely Go for it. Otherwise go for intel processor based laptop.
HP-14-inch-Windows-Natural-14s-fq1030AU,laptop,BEST LAPTOP FOR CODERS AND MULTITASKERS AT THIS RANGE. Just go for it.battery life 5-6 hrs . Performance best .built quality good.I love backlight keyboard.

Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,"Disappointed, slowest speed I seen ever, sigma dealer in Lko has poor performance , battery lost within 1yr, never buy"
Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,Built quality
Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,"This is based on roughly 20 days of usage. The battery life is decent. Performance is good. However, the camera quality feels really poor compared to some of the less expensive Dell laptops I've used. The laptop with headphones on has good sound (used my own in-ear headphones) but not the case without headphones. It also comes with one of those drawing pens - however, there is no stand for the pen, so I'm forced to hold on to the packaging. Another thing, which is Dell's problem not Amazon's, is that the warranty extension process isn't online and even after you register your device on the Dell site, you still need to call the call centre to extend it. This is not the case if you purchase from Dell directly (there was no exchange offer from Dell if I purchased directly, which is why I chose Amazon) and I see no reason why they can't offer the warranty online. This part of the consumer experience hasn't been factored in, in fact it's almost punitive in nature because you're purchasing outside of Dell."
Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,The laptop gets heated up even after a short span of use. It then shuts off due to the over heated condition.  MS Office 2019 pre-installed in the system also failed within 2 months. Excel software does not work and there is no key provided to reinstall the Office.
Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,I would request buyers to kindly check the product before you buy. its a Laptop but you cant keep it on your lap bcoz your thighs will burn. the keypad becomes hot and even if you connect with Dell team they will say that its normal for the laptop to heat up. I bought this product from Croma Store Saket and i feel i wasted my money. please buy any other laptop but not Dell.
Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,"As per dell, Motherboard needs to replace as it is powering off automatically and taking longer time to replace due to unavailability of the part. Laptop is dead since purchase"
Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,"Hello I ordered a laptop Dell Inspiron 5406 11th Gen 14"" , the package indicated that it contains PEN but the pen was not there in the box. Kindly look into this matter asap"
Dell-i3-1125G4-Inspiron-5410-D560531WIN9S,laptop,Delivery was quick and item is very good . As of now I feel it’s a good product and recommended
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,"I've only used this laptop for a day. The version I bought has only 1TB HDD so it takes around 3 min to completely finish boot and ready to use. No SSD and it's 60hz refresh rate. I only played GTA 5 and I saw no lag and very minor stutters in high quality. The fans were running very fast and yet stayed quiet. I haven't measured the battery life yet.... But I think battery might be around 2-3 hr if you're using only for browsing and YT videos. And maybe 1-2 hr if you're gaming. The screen quality is very good. Overall it's a very nice lappie, and I loved it💙. I bought this for around 50k after exchange and bank offers. So it's worth for this price. Hope i get a SSD soon⚡😅"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,"This is a good laptop, for gaming and designing. The laptop finish is premium. Best laptop in this range. And you can upgrade hdd to add and even you upgrade the RAM 8 GB to 16 GB .Only the drawback is the battery life is not good, it work only1.5 hours"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Having owned multiple Lenovo products including the ThinkPad; this one is a bit of a let down. Despite now using it for about a week. It continues to be slow & laggy. Something is amiss here in this config; its either windows update which is pushing the system performance down or its the HDD.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Best laptop from lenovo
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Pros:1.display quality is good 2.such an amazing beast for gaming 🔥 3.it takes 1 hr 50min to take full charge not bad at all  Cons:1.battery drains heavily while Playing a games But apart From that I didn't felt anything cons  Overall: must buy it🤩
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Only disadvantage of using this laptop is HDD used.. instead of HDD they should provide SSD... 256 GB SSD instead of 1TB HDD
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Laptop is good at this range but the battery 🔋 life 🧬 is not 🚫 good and sound quality is not soo good. If we use the full the full brightness then battery backup will give 2 to 3 hour
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Good design with good performance and pretty manageable battery life for gaming and work purpose
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,I liked it all the things of this laptop
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Slow and very low battery backup
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,Click pad wasn't working properly Being a gaming laptop it was hanging Battery was dropping very fast
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,"Guys, I understand its a great gaming laptop considering the price, but no, with the lack of SSD storage I couldn't recommend it in 2021. Luckily it does have an m2 slot for SSD expansion. But for that you will have to go to service center and they will charge you around 5-6k. You can open it by yourself and install but that will void its warranty. So , its better that we go for the SSD variant here amazon.in/dp/B095KQ1G3X  Pros: 1-120hz display perfect for gaming. It's pretty good and the colors are also fine. 2-Performance is superb with SSD 3- 8GB RAM is enough for now. Its DDR4 and fast. 4-Takes around 1 hour 50 mins to full charge. 5-Camera privacy shutter 6-Keyboard is smooth with excellent backlight 7-Touch pad was too good for my liking 8- Gaming on this is amazing, I played most COD titles without any issue and far cry etc.  Things to note : 1- This is not an on the go laptop, so that battery life is only 3-4 hours and its a bit bulky as well 2- Laptops in this range have better speaker quality. But this will get the job done. Anyway you can use a bluetooth speaker for more loudness. 3- Gets slightly heated up, so make sure you are using it near a fan or cooling pad. (most laptops with this graphics gets heated up)  I hope it helps."

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Excellent
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Windows-Graphics-81Y40183IN,laptop,"I have bought the laptop from offline market for rupees 54000. the laptop runs pretty hot in room temperature of 30 c° . the left side of the laptop gets very hot because the is no fan in the left side.so if you plan on buying this laptop for gaming keep in mind that if you play any game which uses CPU and GPU at the same time like gta 5 , battlefield 5 , warzone then the game will leg pretty badly I mean the game will starter it will give you easily 60 plus FPS but 1% low frame rate will drop below 14 15 FPS so the game will feel stattery and to fix this issue you need to to disable the Xbox gamepass you can find the video online in YouTube if you do that then the laptop is very good to game. after all if you want to buy this laptop then I will say you go for the the SSD variant because the hard drive is really really slow the computer takes around 25 second to bootup and the if you are buying from offline please check the GPU first I mean to run some benchmark or something to check the GPU is working or not because I had broken machine then I have to return the machine it took me around 15 days . so goodluck"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Update: I don't know what's wrong with my below comment for Amazon to remove it. Not just comment, who are all given rating 3 and below has been removed. I am really feel agigated by the way negative comments are removed. I am asking to amazon, is it fair to remove poor ratings and keep only higher ratings? Is this not a way of fooling people?  There is lot to say good about it. Primarily if you analyze thin laptop segment with powerful processor and a graphic card you might have spend near to lak. But this one is near half the price in that section. We definelty have to appreciate what MI brought to the market and other brands charging heavily. What they just did for mobiles ( like bringing 30k market price worth of mobile to 10k range without compromising the quality) . They did it for laptop as well. GOOD JOB xiomi.  Performance : As for as thin and light laptop segment this is new benchmark they set for others to follow. You don't see lag at all. So far so good. But need to update this section once after a month of use.  Portability: sometimes I feel the charger provided is same weight as laptop. I feel like a mobile phone on hand when I am holding it  But, there is lot ot say bad about it as well.  Input devices  Trackpad : very pathetic.when u touch it you feel like u touched a unfinished cement surface. It sticks and very hard to navigate around. Highly recommended to buy a seperate mouse to get better experience on this laptop.  Keyboard : though it looks good. It not smooth and feels more plastic. Need to be improvised  No inbuild camera: during the wfh days absence of camera is a huge drawback but there is webcam you need to buy separetely and use it as external device  Charger and display: there is nothing new to excite about except for less bezel. The design is same as like 10 years old laptop.  Overall design: though looks premium feels cheap.. But this is justifiable for the price we pay  Overall User experience: great on performance. But has to improved in many other aspects like input devices , material quality  Overall review : I recommend to buy if you don't think much about feel and want only make full utilization on processing and performance. Otherwise if you expect something premiuim feel this is not for you."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Best in Cost and Feature comparison. It's like a dream come true. I have been using this laptop for last 24 hours.. Following are my observations..  Pros: 1. CPU ==> Intel i7 10th Gen.. Super Smooth... (Wow factor) 2. Memory ==> 512 PCIe Gen 3x4 NvM SSD (Wow factor) 3. RAM ==> 8 GB DDR4 2666 MHz (Wow factor) 4. GPU ==> Nvidia MX350 - 2 GB GDDR5 (Wow factor) 5. Bluetooth 5 ==> Easy to connect all the Bluetooth devices.. energy efficient.. 6. Battery ==> More than enough for 10 hours... 7. Size ==> Super convenient.. 8. Weight ==> under 1.5 kg.. hardly noticeable.. Others.. ==> Boots the system in seconds.. like.. switching on the calculator.. Hardly any lag... It was a dream for me for last 15 years. Games are super smooth..  Cons: 1. Keyboard is little small. It will take sometime to become addicted to this beauty. PgUp and PgDn keys could be bigger. 2. Web camera should be in built. Earlier we were hardly using laptop camera but now a days.. in lockdown period.. work from home and kids having online classes.. it is now mandatory.. Even though happy with the web cam provided with the laptop. 3. Sound quality could have been better.. We can expect Dolby in future model... but this is also not a big issue.. as we can easily connect our good quality Bluetooth headphones... 4. Thunderbolt port could be another addition...  Overall ==> It is a must to have laptop.. for those who love to work hard and also game hard.. BEST Price...  If these details helped you then please feel free to give a thumbs up.. !! Have a nice and safe day.. !!

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,This is my first new laptop in past 12 years and it works just fine. (was using Sony Vaio for the past 12 years) It's amazingly fast as its the i7 + NVME SSD + 8 GB RAM version. I am not professional in writing a review but please refer the below observations: 1. Screen is super bright. 2. Transition is very smooth between different applications. 3. Fan does make a noise if you open many applications together. 4. Keyboard is okay. 5. The bezel less screen gives u a different experience all together. 6. Does gives u a feel of Poor man's Apple macbook ;) 7. Volume is also bit okay as its a notebook.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,the trackpad is very very poor. Makes a lot of rattling noise. No gliding. You get better trackpads in 30k laptop. Sound is the third class. You may be thinking you'll Manage it. you are going to spend 60k. Why to compromise on these basic thing.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It has a SSD card. The length of the video tells you how long it takes to start when it should be on in less than 10 seconds. Unlike other laptops, when you press the power button in this Mi Horizon laptop, you have to wait for 7 seconds to be sure the laptop is on. Utterly disappointed. This issue is on the first day of purchase."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"The display is blur and fuzzy, pure waste of money. RAM can't be expanded in future, those who will buy will regret forever.  Laptop Display screen is horrible, it's blurry and fuzzy. You will not be able to read texts clearly."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"There is simply no complaint! Baught the horizon top edition.  I like the great display, extremely light weight, fast charging and zero heat dissipation and zero noise.  Regular laptop! Dont take it as gaming substitute."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I bought this product just 10 days back and sparingly used. And there is a problem with display - having vertical and horizontal lines on the screen.  Just 2 days after the return policy, the problem started. Amazon is not ready to take back the product  Dont think I will come back to Amazon or buy any MI Products from now on.  Very typical of a Chinese company. Seriousyly disappointed"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Nice product
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"in notebook horizon I love the sturdy aluminum unibody chassis. Weighing at just 1.35 kg, the notebook is slim and extremely light. It’s thin, too. I am also glad to see that despite its size and weight, the notebook has plenty of ports including a Type-C port for data transfer and charging, an HDMI 1.4 port, two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and a headphone jack. but there is missing from the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is a microSD card slot and Thunderbolt 3 support Didplay is also too good.. in speaker there is no too much voice but good not best keyboard is good for me but if u need backlight , backlight is not there i love the performance of laptop just take few sec to open it's barvo.. and the weight of laptops extremely light that's why i also like it.. for me there is only one problem that is speaker. i need high voice but that is not there."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,No lifetime Microsoft office. No in built camera. No backlit keyboard. Track pad is cheap in construction. No carrying bag provided. Type c port doesn't change notebook. Provided charger is heavy on weight.  The list goes on...
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Before purchase, I went through several reviews of MI Horizon 14"" notebook. Some of them mentioned about the lack of an in-built camera, the notebook getting hot during gaming & the processor's thermal throttling kicking in, its RAM being not upgradable, its touch-pad being little mushy to operate, lack of a back-lit keyboard etc. I also noticed that even the rating system of Amazon India requires the customers to rate a notebook based on the quality of the in-built camera, and as to whether the notebook could be used for gaming. But then, I had my reasons when I went ahead, and bought the Core i7 version of the MI Horizon 14"" notebook.  I believe that while buying a notebook, one has to be clear about the purpose. Style comes close second as a priority.  My use for the notebook is for office document creation. Moreover, I am a touch-typist who doesn't need to look at the keyboard while typing. In addition, a back-lit keyboard would be a drain on the notebook battery. So, a back-lit keyboard was not a priority for me.  Secondly, I am not a gamer, and even if I were, I would deploy a proper gaming rig for the purpose, and certainly not a 14"" portable notebook. So considerations of gaming did not affect my notebook purchase.  I prefer using a Logitech Full HD webcam for video-conferencing, as it has been my observation that webcams built into the notebooks usually have poor optical performance. Built-in webcam can also be a security risk sometimes. Xiaomi 's own survey had shown that a webcam is not a priority for most notebook users, but this was before the COVID-19 pandemic (You see, the Chinese did not see the pandemic coming! 😜).  As to the RAM being soldered on to the motherboard, many brands are doing this to reduce the thickness of the notebook. Providing RAM connectors on the motherboard not only adds to the thickness of the notebook, but also adds potential failure points. Removing RAM connectors from the motherboard and directly soldering the RAM on to the motherboard shaves off some cost that could be deployed elsewhere during notebook design. Besides, 8 GB of RAM is abundant for my requirement, and when the need for upgrade comes, it will be of the notebook and not of the RAM. Therefore, soldered RAM was not my concern!  The design emphasis in MI Horizon 14"" notebook is on minimalism. This was to my liking. There is no MI logo anywhere, but at the bottom of the bezel below the screen. There aren't a plethora of blinking LED lights as one would notice in some Fujitsu notebooks. Only a single tiny green LED indicator exists near the power connector socket. The bezels of the screen are super-slim, and the notebook's lid can be opened with a single finger.  The TouchPad is also minimalistic. The left and right mouse buttons aren't demarcated on the surface of the TouchPad, which assumes the shape of a single rectangular area below the keyboard. You press the right bottom corner of the TouchPad, you hear the click of the right mouse button, and vice-versa! The keyboard is neatly laid out, and is very comfortable to touch type at full speed.  Coming to the screen, the display is indeed an eye-candy. It is far above in quality compared to several other notebooks which boast of a Full HD screen. I wouldn't go so far as to rate the screen high in terms of colour accuracy or Adobe RGB compliance. I would only say that I could effortlessly edit the RAW imagery from my Sony Alpha camera, thanks to the bright display.  Overall, a stylish all rounder notebook, provided you are aligned with its design philosophy!"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Good design build quality super Mi laptop supports direct casting also need to choose Nvidia graphics by default graphics set to UHD graphics and also need to set custom audio sounds For better audio output choose user and then enable all Encahces modes along with traditional mode settings Cons : 1.No backlight 2.Ram expand not possible as soldered to mother board 3.touch pad is slight need to improve 4.No HDD slot and only 2gb graphic card 5.Speakers are located bottom if it was on top it might good
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"First of all I assure you that you'll be very happy with this laptop. Keyboard is awesome Whole system is fast Fast turn on and off Screen is really good, can viewed from all angles clearly Fan doesn't turn on until heavy apps/sofrware/games used No heating problem Battery is good Budget is good ig Small and compact One finger open  Problems: Sound is less but it's managable No fingerprint reader No microsoft 365 permanent plan Track pad could be little better but ok  It's a must buy for this price segment. When it comes to laptop it's not about brand anymore, it's more about specifications."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,The laptop is enveloped in a metal body which may give an impression that the Mi Notebook is bulky - but the laptop weighs just 1.3 kilograms which makes it very portable. The laptop feels light and does not have any branding on the top surface. The weight balance is such that you can open the lid with just one finger. Over all experience is awesome
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I love this laptop for it's awesome.  Pros:- 1. Great screen quality (it's a matte finish) 2. Brilliant Build quality (it's an aluminium unibody construction) 3. Smallest footprint for a 14"" screen (has almost no bezels)  Cons:- 1. RAM is just 8 GB. (Although I didn't face any issues yet) 2. Keys on the keyboard don't offer any resistance. (almost feels like the keys will get pressed even if a feather falls on them) 3. Trackpad quality is inferior. (Although I don't care since I use an external mouse anyway)"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Very classy product after 25 days use I didn't find any issues davinci resolve and Adobe premiere runs smoothly. I didn't play heavy games but euro truck gameplay is good. Very light weight easy to handle. Battery give almost 9 hrs standby in video streaming. By using heavier softwares battery drained in 5-6hrs. Overall the product is very good in this price range. I7 10 gen processor is rocking 🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I bought i7 horizon edition.  I used roughly for 5 days for surity of its performance with confidence of replace, but its glad to look that it doesn't have any single issue..  Track pad is not very much good.  I bought it for programming and its working well. Also its doing great for editing.  Except its made in China, I didn't found any issue.  Also some people complain about heating but believe me it doesn't heating during my work. Ya might be possible during hard gaming it might get heated.  Its battery backup is about 7 to 8 hrs of internet uses for my use.  My recommendation is that those who need a laptop for working as a student or employee they should definitely go for it with the price of 60k.  Otherwise there is many other options ."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Good budget laptop, no issues so far, suggest you buy camera different brand as the camera provided is very bad quality.  Overall battery and performance is good.  If you are expecting free windows office, better go for lenovo as the version provided is trail and last only 1 month.  Keyboard is okay not perfect.  You will be boltware softwares which are pre loaded .  Buy this laptop with little expectations and keep in mind this is budget laptop."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Guys please buy this only if you can work on only day time. I don’t know who’s I’d product manager for this product and they call more power to productivity ...ha ha Anyways 1. Display is good 2. Battery back is good 5+ hr Why not to buy . 1. You can’t work in night no backlight for keyboard and this is productivity laptop ha ha . 2. Audio is average. 3. notebook build quality expected good. 4. Camera quality is avg. 5. No card reader port and fingerprint. 6. After using 10 days, Speed/performance is Poor with android studio.  Performance wise worth of money and productivity wise you can look for other models.  Mi failed in giving productivity laptop which claims horizon is build for great Productivity."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"1. Its display size is too small and dull. Sound quality is also too average. 2. It doesn't have a backlit keyboard. Now even 30 K value laptop has that feature 3. A separate camera feels really awkward. A few mm increase in the bezel size doesn't hurt. 4. No option for a ram upgrade. 8 GB won't be enough 5. It looks like under 15 k value laptop and feels like built from plastic, not metal. 6. No extended warranty option, as purchased from amazon. 7. You can only replace, can't return it, bad policy.  The Processor and batter don't justify the 60 K value. So Instead of that, I would recommend HP Omen series."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I bought the product, seeing what the company claims upto 10 hours back up .. and its only giving 6 to 6.5 hours in full charge and how can they claim upto 10 hours ... Either the product I recieved is faulty or the company is lying literally.. so guys watch out before you buy the product... volume is very low.. up switch on a fan you can hear anything ."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"After 14 days it wasn't starting after power on. Only fan is running. High end laptop, not expected from mi. Consulted customer service and to be taken to service center. So better to wait till the solution by mi company. Pl see other reviews on the same issues. They could return within 10 days policy. But mine .."

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Reviewing it after 12 days of usage. Trust me amazing product at this price. I would say best product in 14inch screen size. Please go for it if you want an unbelievable performing laptop. I am playing Far Cry 5 it is running as smoothly as in those giant gaming laptops by Asus, Dell. Just one thing the volume is really low. But what could you expect more in this price. They are giving you latest graphic card latest processor and what else. Use earphone while playing games. Coming to battery, so if you are not gaming then it is amazingly high performing battery. Almost 8 hours I used with all browsing coding etc etc and still 12% is remaining there. But if you are gaming then better plug your charger. Because it drains the battery quickly during gaming. And obviously it will drain, it is only a 14 inch laptop and having very small space and one fan which runs high during gaming so battery drains in high rate. Will update more after 1 month. Update after 7 months. Very much satisfied with this laptop. Really amazing battery life and I almost never close my laptop just make it in log off mode. Go for this little monster."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"This laptop deserves all the Five Stars.  The Spec that MI has offered is Amazing while keeping the price almost half to their rivals for Lappy with similar specs.  It seems to be silly that the list of cons posted by others like no inbuilt camera, trackpad and keyboard. Nowhere MI has claimed that they have a backlight on the keyboard & there is a camera in built. The trackpad is good and has a matt finish. It is clear to the buyer before placing the order, but there is no point in mentioning these as Cons of the laptop. The built quality is decent and the laptop looks premium. You pay only half and the quality of the used material will obviously in line with what you paid.  The reading and writing speeds are best, thanks to the 512 GB NVMe SSD. 8GB RAM is decent enough for a programmer and mild user. Nvidia MX350 2GB GDDR5 Graphics card found to be good for moderate to light heavy games. As the laptop is light and thin, the battery backup (5 to 6 hours is what I get for moderate use) is a little less than the rivals offerings. It's a budget MacBook and please go for it without a second thought."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Dear All, After using it for 6 Days from the date of delivery I am writing this Review. While using the Mi Notebook, Burning Smell is Always Coming with too much of Heat. I suggest not to Buy This Mi Notebook."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Good to have a meetings, presentation etc. But for development and online teaching activities it's not a best feet as screen size is small, I had to purchase external monitor to overcome this issue. No inbuilt camera, I miss this feature lot. I feel now like I am using desktop as I have to use external monitor and webcam for my day to day work. One more thing the camera which is included in this was not delivered and I had to purchase it again with paying more cost."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Excellent notebook, no second question on that front. However, there are some caveats. 1) Although madeup of metal, feels fragile. 2) Vents are so big on the bottom, we can see circuits, that means ex: water can get in on accidental skills. Be very very careful. 3) speakers are bottom firing, almost non existent on trying to watch movies, you need external speakers. 4) Web cam is not internal. 5) you can never upgrade RAM. 6) No backlight key board... Come on.. Living in 90's ?"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"great laptop if you get it under 60k , comes with a bundled camera which is of average quality and delivers 720p of video, display of this device us a huge plus point , i loved its almost bezel less approach and nice srgb coverage. second thing, the battery is long long long lasting , in my case it lasted approx 9hr since i watched complete DARK season one in the single charge .  cons: the only con i found that its trackpad makes a clicky sound which make it feel like the cheap quality one. but apart from that wierd sound it is functioning very well  people who are looking for a sleek , powerful or long lasting laptop should go for it , do not think of gaming one if your conditions matches with those above mentioned"

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,There is a lot of technical issues with the product. After one month of usage the laptop is giving notifications that the Windows license has expired.  The keyboard of the laptop and the key travel is a mess. It’s in the middle of the apple an HP keyboard. It’s not good for the long usage typing experience.  The product feels like cheap plastic and since there is no branding it makes the product look even more generic.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,The first thing you would love is its compact form. The first thing you would hate is its flimsy trackpad. Display is good. Brighness is fine. I dislike that SSD it is pre-partitioned. Should have left it my way. Mi Blaze unlock is fine and so is regular work with productivity apps. Not having backlit is a bad move. Keyboard experience is good. Volumes are at best average ! Good for a budget

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,I have purchased this laptop 16 days back and I think this is the good time to write the review. Basically I am developer and purchased this laptop for development purpose. Performance 5/5 Look 5/5 Battery life 6-8 hours based on type of work you are doing Screen quality very good. Keyboard is very poor small keys and you have to spend good time to get used to of keyboard. Trackpad is not that much bad which I have seen in reviews. Sound quality is very poor. If you want to do tough work or gaming don’t go for this laptop.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I hv purchased it.Now I feel cheated. Laptop build quality is very very bad,metallic look is only a illusion you can clearly see in photo there is no grill inside laptop to prevent motherboard from dust.I seriously think it will not last more than 1 year.Moreover if you are concerning it to buy for video recording don't even think of it as most of the softwares like obs don't take graphic card below 600 and it's 350.You will definitely going to regret it after buying.I wish there might be a return policy but as per policy it's only for replacement"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,i bought this product thinking that it has a i7 10th Gen processor but seems like it is useless as other hardware is pathetic. I try to load a game and it restarting every time when I try to run the game. after some time use its mouse pad stopped working. Really a big disappointment
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I didn't got web camera ,web camera missing in my package"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,DO NOT go for it people. I fell for cost and the fake ratings. I bought the Horizon i7 (top end variant) proudly thinking i am future proof now. I have bought many laptops for my family and myself but none went dead after just 15 days of use. Called the helpline which was of no help. I have booked an appointment at the service station. Bottom line - Why should you even buy something that doesn't last 15 days. Buy a toilet disinfectant...probably that will last longer and will work as promised if not better. Buy a trusted brand. I made a mistake buying MI
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Putting the cons aside, what this machine offers at 60k is a steal deal. No matter what u throw at it, it gets the job done slickly. Also impressed by the display quality, which I didn't expect to be this good."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"It boots and shuts down faster than 2019 MacBook air. Runs Android Studio, emulator, VSCode, 5-6 chrome tabs, and a bunch of PDFs absolutely lag free! 10/10 would recommend this for students of all fields"

POOR GPU. *NIVIDA GPU'S ARE USALLY VERY GOOD, BUT THIS GPU IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. 5. BAD customer service for the warranty. 6. HEATS UP VERY QUICKLY. EVEN IF THIS LAPTOP IS IN SLEEP MODE, THIS THING HEATS UP SO BADLY. AND FORGET ABOUT IT WHEN IT IS ON HIGH PERFORMANCE MODE. IT CAN FRY AN EGG. 7. JUST BUY A DELL LAPTOP!"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Nearly the best laptop. Great build quality of top notch specs at nearly 60% of cost. However an integrated Camera is missing as well the RAM cannot be increased.  Machine performance is currently outstanding.

It was really slight at the First boot while I was charging and using it. When you rub slightly over it you feel the flow of current. I think it's an issue with the motherboard as current is leaking from it.  The charger gets really hot like burning.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"This is a laptop with latest configuration, very high speed but I did not want Windows as I already own a copy and there is no option to purchase without Windows."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Worst laptop, gives random blue screen error (BSOD).

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I was apprehensive about buying a relatively new brand in laptops and after extensive research , i decided to take the plunge . I am super happy with it for the following reasons 1) small, sleek and really light 2) High end configuration 3) Superb battery life, lasts almost 3 days with my typical usage 4) very quick start up 5) Good VFM considering the competition"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I bought this laptop a couple of months back, not from amazon though. It is a great machine at an unbeatable price. I don’t think it is suitable for high end gaming, but the overall performance is pretty good. I bought this after struggling with my i3 3rd gen for many months. Finally decided to upgrade and went for this one as it was crazy value for money. So far it has not disappointed. It is compact in size, has a solid build (trackpad is a little noisy though) and looks premium for nearly half the price tag. The only let down is the absence of backlit keyboard. But it is definitely better than using an i5 laptop for the same price 🤪 Battery backup is pretty good on low to medium brightness. The speakers could be a little better, but I’ve seen much worse on laptops. Go for it without second thoughts."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Did a lot of research and finally pick this.. really good at performance. Decent sound. Trackpad not up to the mark. So for 60k i didn't find anything better than this
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Bought this laptop last October. Keyboard not working. Service center facility bad. Got No online help... Wastage of money totally
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,We designed and structured laptop but above all Amazon is the best service provider and really very apt services experienced so far
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"3 rd class laptop worth not more than 2 rs #boycott chinese,"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"See I bought Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition i7-10th gen, Now it has been One month with it. II never experienced any kind of lag, maybe because I don't do heavy video editing.... This laptop is best for Office work , Students , Teachers and Personal use... You can also use this for gaming and video editing also... I'll tell You the Pros and Cons about this laptop...  Pros:-  Processor : I searched all the laptops available in India. Non has i7 with a range of 60k and also you can i7 7th gen for 72.5k.  Storage : It has the latest SSD. I experienced very fast transfer of files in just a while.(I am talking about whole Series about 7-10 GB)  RAM : 8GB DDR4 with 2666 GHz speed.(Just Wow)  Weight : Very Light Weight , You won't even feel that this is with you....  Body : The body is made out of Aluminium which give it a premium look, And its back is purely plane ...(Which mean you can customize as you wish or if you like it plane let it be.)  Boot : You don't have to shutdown every time, you can just lock it or put it in sleep or can hibernate...(I prefer hibernating as it Always takes the work from where we left it and saves the battery very much...)And also it takes 2.1s to boot up.(I have kept BIOS password so it takes longer or it would have been much faster... I just want to say it boots up very fast...)  Graphics card : I have not used the graphic card much so I can't mention anything , but I can say this for sure it would be powerful...  Display : The most interesting part... It has a matte finished Display, which never reflects any reflection as a normal display do... It is very Bright, so I always keep the brightness at 1 unless when I'm sitting under sunlight... It has 91% screen to body ratio...  Fan : While playing any game its fans gets boosted up and runs at the high speed.... This may not happen when you are just Normally using your laptop...  Cons :-  Keyboard : Its doesn't have a backlit keyboard, but I think you don't need a backlit keyboard if you have a very bright screen. if also the brightness is at 1 the whole room brightens up.If you want the focus to be at the keyboard then just tilt your screen ...  Cover : I am not able to find a cover for the screen and touch pad, And also I'm not able to find a back cover or sticker of its size...  Touch pad : It is a little bit small. But it is justifiable as if they give a larger touch pad then they would have to make the laptop much bigger and the bezels would have been larger...  Student : If you are a student who have to keep their camera ON all the time then it would be a Difficulty to carry the camera... If you don't have to keep your camera On all the time then it is best for you... And also without inbuilt camera we get PRIVACY, In the era of Cyber attacks PRIVACY is very important, this makes sure that you don't loose your privacy...  AT THE MOST LAST : this is your choice that which Laptop, who are we to tell you that which one to buy which one to not... The decision is yours... Just check whether the laptop has the features you want or not.... In my opinion you should buy this laptop if you are a Student , teacher , or just for office use or personal use... I would not recommend this for Hard-core Gamer..."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I bought this laptop. Within one month, mouse pad is gone. Now I am searching service center. Very worst laptop in my life time"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Supper
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"When I first saw the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition, I thought the laptop would be as expensive as the Dell XPS 13 or a MacBook Air. It’s got an aluminum build, an extremely comfortable keyboard, latest Intel processors, and a screen with the thinnest bezels in the market. All of those features, I just mentioned, are trademark of any high-end laptop these days. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package.  Pros: - 14-inch FHD Anti-glare display with minimal bezels - Intel Core i7 (10th generation) - 512GB NVMe SSD - Nvidia GeForce MX350 - 1.35kg - Up to 10 hours of battery (practically lasts somewhere around 6-8 hours depending on your work) - Premium looks - Well priced (I won't call agressive pricing though) - Beautiful scissor-style keyboard with 1.3mm key travel  Cons: - No backlit keyboard in 2020 is a crime - Lack of a built-in webcam. Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much - The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age - The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook’s 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board - The audio system on the notebook is weak. The stereo speakers don’t get loud. Plus, they lack bass  The laptop has a good design, better processing power and keyboard than every other Windows laptop in this price bracket. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone within this price bracket."
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-M513IA-BQ512TS,laptop,"Overall finish, design, style and weight of the laptop is appealing and easy to carry. * Battery - on calls/working on ppt, Excel etc works for around 5-6 hours * Performance - no lags encountered yet, app refresh rate is superb and multitasking doesn't make it slow * Audio - not too loud but clear and crisp enough to listen to music while working and for taking video calls. * Display - details are excellent, goes easy to eyes so helpful in working long hours on screen * Keyboard - backlight keyboard is always a plus, keys are nearly placed in terms of reach. * Fingerprint scanner - it is as fast as any flagship smartphone in the market today. * Space/RAM management - you have an option to upgrade RAM and add HDD which will keep it compatible to new tech for a longer period of time. Boot up time/turn on time is whooping 9.6 seconds (including a moment taken to read fingerprint) which is really fast at this price point.  Cons : * No Lan port * Camera quality is not great however is manageable. * Body material holds fingerprints marks while using however can be easily cleaned so not a big problem"
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-M513IA-BQ512TS,laptop,"The performance of this laptop is outstanding. Be that its boot speed or multitasking abilities, everything is perfect. The build quality is quite good and the backlit keyboard is clearly visible in the dark. But this laptop could have had a better camera. The camera quality is extremely poor. This issue could still be resolved with an external webcam. But this laptop's battery life is horrible. After light to medium usage, it lasts for barely five to six hours. The battery percentage goes down in number very fast, and this could be a matter of concern. Apart from that, this laptop is absolutely worth the money you spend on it. You could go for it without any second thoughts, provided you get yourself a powerful power bank to use the laptop on the go!"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,One of the worst laptop. I had a 10yrs old dell laptop which was a basic one but much better. Very very slow.
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"The laptop is extremely slow even for very basic tasks like browsing the internet. It take 5 minutes for Google Chrome to open and each time you open a new tab, the whole screen freezes for a few minutes"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"Worst laptop ,worst battery backup ,too slow , worst camara and hang sometimes As per my point of view it worst so look other laptop . Worst package . Its not full HD only HD worst display don't buy my suggestion"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"Product : Laptop having Intel Core i3-1005G1 10th Gen with 4GB RAM and 256GB SSD Drive  It's a good buy for normal office work for instance multitasking with accounting software along with 3-4 excel spreadsheet, 3-4 pdfs, email in outlook logged-in, and couple of web browsing tab open. For students mostly it will be the same scenario plus HD videos and not too heavy / minor graphic games,  It's best to perform Initial set-up / boot-up fresh from out-of-box offline (as almost all windows version/ edition has telemetry which is data & system resource hungry) and disable all privacy options, remove / uninstall the bloatware (one may use cc-cleaner if find it difficult to remove), disable background apps other than security software, also disable unnecessary ASUS services (here again one may use cc-cleaner). With such initial setting, and when connected to internet, system resource utilization out burst to the peek and later-on works absolutely fine having RAM utilization stands at 25-35 %, Disk Read activity is also low.  Few things could have been better placed 1. Power Button is adjacent to Delete button, and if pressed accidently turn-off the laptop (sleep mode). Although it can be fixed in power option by selecting ""Do Nothing"". It should have been placed somewhere else  2. Would have been best if comes with RJ-45 port i.e. ethernet port  3. Keyboard could have backlight  4. VGA Camera is actually neither here nor there, but HD camera should have been better"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"The machine is well built, has a premium look and feel. I went for the 256 gb SSD version with i3. Its lightning fast, boots instantly. There is no lag or waiting period. It has 4 gb RAM which is more than sufficient. This has made me very convinced that the real difference between speed of machines comes from HDD Versus SSD, not processors or RAM. I have struggled recently with HP laptop having i3 processor and 4 gb ram, BUT HDD. It took more than 10 minutes to boot! This ASUS laptop is real value for money. Its slightly heavy, but then look at the price point! I would say, for most people its perfect."

The NVMe is WD SN530 256GB . Sound quality is also decent at this price range. Ok, the problem which i faced is ssd corruption. The laptop only lasted 8hours.

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,It very bad product. It does not work properly. It takes too much time to get start and shut down. Apps not works. It takes 10-30 mints to start any app or system. I felt myself cheated with this product. I called the customer care but they did not give any solution for return or refund. I want to return product. But amazon does take any action. All depends on the technician they said.
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,I zeroed in on this product after extensive research. I needed a fast laptop with decent specifications and good sound & camera for the purpose of my son attending his online classes. I expected a quality product in the price range it commanded but it's not so. What I got is an average product with bad sound and camera. Speed is Ok only with fiber connection but buffering & freezing while using Broadband (which is not so even in our old generation desktop). Will have to buy external speakers and webcam.
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,Don't go for this one. I'm warning you because I have ordered this laptop on 9th of may 2021 and it came after 18 days on 27 th may.After 4 days I have replaced this order with a new one because it got hanged and the cursor just vanished.Such a terrible experience with this one.On 31st may I have ordered a new one and it took 15 days to tell me the product is unavailable.Fortunately I got my refund after cancellation.Of you guys want to avoid harassment don't go for this one ever.My personal experience says it all
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"A i3 core processor, is so slow cannot do anything. I am so sad to have purchased this idiotic Asus. My other HP laptops which are old but much better. Worst purchase, no back-lit keypad. Never knew this."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,Asus is offering a good deal for low budget customers also. I like the product . I would like to ask amazon to offer more flexible emi duration because I would have bought 45000 rs worth laptop if the emi duration was 9 months from bajaj emi. Because of shortage of my income I only could buy this laptop.

It offered nice features for its price range, but the actual face of this laptop is revealed when it reached home. I bought the 4gb 1tb version, considering long term use. But this piece of garbage takes a decade to boot, and to open an app, it takes longer. This is an electronic item, so Amazon doesn't support returns. It might first give an impression that it has value for the money we pay, but that'll last only until it reaches us. I've made the mistake of buying this, and I'll never recommend it to anybody. My 6 year old laptop works better than this. The camera is just awful. Overall this product gave me a completely dissatisfying experience.  PS : Mine is the 1tb version, I don't know exactly about the boot speed and stuff of 256 GB SSD version"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"Laptop was very slow, it had some hard disk issue which was difficult to prove.

Also, this laptop comes with a fingerprint sensor and is very lightweight to carry. Also, it will get windows 11. Plus the display quality and speaker outputs are good considering the price. The thermals are great. So without any hesitation go for the laptop"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"Pls don't go with this product. Purchased for minimal office work like ms office. But it's very very slow. Hang every often.

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,"Bought this laptop 1 month back. I am disheartened to say that this ASUS product is not at all upto the mark. It is too slow. Bought for my son's online classes. He is not been able to attend his classes as it takes 15 mins to load and keeps on hanging in between. I have registered a complaint to ASUS, which was to be serviced in 2-3 days but it has been more than 10 days I have not received even a call. On further enquiring they are giving excuses of Corona when whole of Delhi is open from last 15 days. I will suggest please don't buy this laptop."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,Horrible product and horrible service! Do not buy this product. They don’t even give the warranty.

He said get the RAM extended at the Asus service centre which is in some remote part of the city. I got the RAM extended - laptop is still slow. Even chrome doesn’t work properly! I might have to throw it because nobody will even buy a slow second hand laptop!

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1005G1-Integrated-X415JA-EK104T,laptop,Worst laptop performance as far I have seen. It is just portable to see but the performance is too low.

Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"If you want a laptop for basic stuff like browsing, online classes, light coding, share trading, etc this pretty much delivers on all fronts on a budget. Although you have to do some things to make it useable with some upgrades as in its stock form its painfully slow. If you don't want to upgrade just get rid of mcafee. Now i'm advising this assuming you're careful enough to not get viruses. This step alone brings back some life into this machine and is use-able after this altough on slower side.  If you really want see what this capable just pop in a SSD stick and some more ram.  This Laptop has 1 empty nvme slot for ssd and 1 empty ram slot. The 4gb RAM which comes with the laptop is soldered on motherboard. Also max RAM listed on lenovo website for this model is 12gb but I think it can go till 20gb as I see same model selling with it on international websites. You can try at your own risk. Opening the laptop is pretty easy, all you need is standard philips screwdriver and a guitar pick(for opening the plastic locks). Plenty of youtube videos on same.  I've installed WD blue 500gb SSD and 8GB Ram stick. After this, the laptop just flies. Windows boots under 5 sec (with windows 10 fast startup).  Do note, there is no nvme ssd mounting screw given in this laptop. Also there is no mounting screw given with the WD ssd as well. Not sure who should have given it, but if you get stuck in this scenario you can use one small screw from laptop case.  I also tried Ubuntu Linux. It is also working without any issues.  Below are some minor cons I've noticed so far  - If you install more ram, graphics card starts eating more memory. Like with addition of 8gb RAM, I only get 10gb use-able RAM as radeon eats 2gb as vram. It would have been great if lenovo bios had ability to control this allocation like some other laptops, but its not the case with this laptop. If you're not into gaming or graphics related work, its pretty much wasted.  - Color reproduction and brightness of screen is just ok, nothing great. But atleast its full hd.  - Touchpad doesn't allow you to change scroll direction. They force you with new natural scroll. If you aren't comfortable with it you need to do complicated windows registry change.  - Battery life is on lower side like between 2-3 hours depending on usage due to 2-cell battery.  - Webcam quality is pretty bad. If you just want to show your face on online meetings and such its fine, otherwise consider investing in dedicated webcam.  - The keyboard layout is different from standard laptop due to presence of numeric keypad on this. I didn't think it would be an issue while buying, but numbers of typo's I'm getting while typing is quite annoying.  Overall I'm rating it 4 stars. I got this laptop at 23k after bank offers and upgrades costed another 8k. I'm pretty sure the performance i'm getting is more than what you get with intel i3 configs at around 35-37k. The processor performance is similar to ryzen 3 3250u. Geekbench 5 CPU score with 10gb RAM is 738 (single core) and 1834 (multi core). OpenCL compute score is 4471.  ***Do let me know if you found this review helpful by clicking the HELPFUL button below Tks. It encourages me to spend more time on writing reviews :-)"
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"Hey guys most of the bad reviews i read, the issue is HDD, please install SSD you can get this laptop speed much faster. As per my view Windows 10 not suitable for HDD user for any laptop even thinkpad itself. SSD additionally cost you 2-3k once installed you can see the difference. use your removed HDD as external Hard drive using HDD enclosure."
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"Do not go for this product, it’s a very very very slow in process. Even a pentium will work better then this AMD processor."
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,The speed is slow and it sucks when you really need it. It's the second day and without installing any other apps it stopped working.
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,Full Hd in this price is Awesome. Looks is premium. I have removed pre-installed antivirus I have installed 256 Gb Ssd and removed HDD.  After this laptop is working super fine.  Battery back is giving 5 to 6 hours. Use usb cables for internet to extend battery life and turn off wifi.  Cons- Viewing Angles not good. You have to sit in front to view properly.
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"I was a bit worried by seeing all the negative comments but after the laptop arrived, i was happy to see the laptop in perfect condition.  But strangely, a screw was rattling inside the box, then later I found out it was a screw from the bottom of the laptop. Then later I screwed it in. I found all other screws to be loose as well, I suppose these were manufactured in a rush.  The Window 10 was bloated with few softwares which I don't use so I uninstalled them (McAffe - Trial, MS Office - Trial, MS OneDrive).  Out of the box, only 3.4 GB of RAM is usable, rest is used by the iGPU.  At idle, the RAM usage is between 1.9~2.1GB, leaving only 1.1 to 1.3GB for you to use with.  The on-board soldered RAM is clocked at 2400MHz.  The screen was reasonably bright and it was good overall.  The trackpad seems dented slightly inwards on the left side, functionally it doesn't have any issues.  The Camera was OK for this price range, and is perfectly fine for a decent video call meeting.  I bought this for ₹29,690. I'd say it's a reasonable price for a better CPU and Upgradability.  Even with a HDD, it doesn't feel that slow as mentioned in other reviews. boot time was 19 seconds, I'd say that ain't bad. This might vary with the usage of the laptop, but nothing to complain about.  Let me know if this was Helpful!"
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"Worst configuration if you Don't shell out Money. Slowest like a Snail and completely NOT FIT for either Work nor Online Classes. But if you add a 250 GB NVME SSD along with another 4 GB RAM, the lappy runs awesome. But that is another 7 - 8 K of money I'm talking about. So THINK before you buy."
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"Just a piece of garbage there is nothing,I am just feeling as robbed by amazone..I alws purchase product from Amazon but this time it is just useless and rubbish laptop.it works so slow even snail can defeat him in race."
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"It's a good product overall. The only limitation is that it gets stuck in the middle of the process. If you've opened more than 5 tabs in Chrome, it will stop responding unless yoi don't clear out the cache."
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,Worst laptop I have ever seen its taking 10 min to open any pages
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,Horrible when it comes to speed and internet reception.
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,Don't buy this laptop Its really really slow My 10 year old pc works faster than this Really bad experience
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,"The design and appearance is nice. But the processor is old.  But for me, they delivered a defective product-- power button is not working properly-- and I got refunded"
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700JEIH,laptop,Not bad it's good for kids online classes

Lenovo-Intel-Laptop-Windows-82C500XWIH,laptop,"Writing the review after 1 day of usage or after struggling to use the laptop The laptop is very very slow , even with 2-3 tabs of internet sites are loading like its forever. Starting time is very long for more than 5 minutes you cant expect anything from laptop. I dont know but 4 GB RAM should not be so slow , I have used it on many laptops & desktops. there is some serious problem with laptop processor/windows update/reason unknow to me"
Lenovo-Intel-Laptop-Windows-82C500XWIH,laptop,"I am using Lenovo V15 (2021) for about 1 week. In the beginning, I find it a bit slow but when I updated the preinstalled Windows 10 then it becomes smoother. I recommend updating the preinstalled Windows 10 to the latest possible version otherwise you will get slowdown or lagging issues.  It would be best to increase the ram to 8GB to get the maximum of this laptop."
Lenovo-Intel-Laptop-Windows-82C500XWIH,laptop,No one help you when you get faulted product.  Go for local shopping
Lenovo-Intel-Laptop-Windows-82C500XWIH,laptop,The system is very slow in the beginning...hangs in between...speaker out put is low...Not as per excitement at the time of purchase...but good for normal use. ...
Lenovo-Intel-Laptop-Windows-82C500XWIH,laptop,Very slow.can't even start.or click on any icon very bad product.can't believe it's having an i3 cpu
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"I'm using this for past 1 week without any issues. Overall product is good with smooth performance, good resolution, pre-installed MS products etc. Could have been better with backlit keyboard, finger sensor & camera cover option which is available in 15"" inch variant."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,Super awesome laptop....runs smoothly ...valorant runs on it like fluid...just amazing
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Light weight,smooth to work , processing is better"
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,Worst ever product i got it... They mentioned processer is 4.2GHz in specification and when it came it was 2.42GHz ....and when replaced that same product came with 4.2GHz. And now when i am calling to return it no one is receiving call..... Even with app also i am not able to place return order it says to contact us and which again does not get connected... Really frustrated with such service
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,It says Full HD screen and they delivered with a HD Ready screen.  My mistake is that I didn't search for the model no and check on hp website.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,Pls don't buy Laptop or costly things from Amazon. They give used products and then don't replace it I recd approx Rs 59000 laptop which was used since April 21 as per HP site. I purcahded it is July 21 It is sluggish and slow and like old i3 laptop. Their reolacememg inspection agency did not visit my house and replace request was denied. I learned a lesson by spending approx Rs 59000. Pls don't buy Now tjey
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Truly disappointed with HP . Its a corei5 11th gen laptop, which heats up like old amd laptops. I urge everyone not to go for this one. HP need to think and change this model. Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return"
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I am very disappointed with this laptop because. I got the replaced product. But it is very very worst product ever. Please don't buy this laptop. Heating Issues + charger Heating Issue + laptop hang issue. This laptop battery is working only upto 3 hrs. Worst class Laptop😡😡
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,I was already requested for return. 1. Laptop is overwhelming issue. 2. As mentioned in specification processor speed is not matching with delivered item.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Very good product. After switching on it gets ready to use in less than 10 seconds and gets switch off in less than 5 seconds. Using multiple tabs at a time does not make anything slow. Heavy word, excel and PowerPoint usage is also smooth. Product is recent launch in 2021 and very useful in working from home or for online tasks. Best value for money. I exchanged by Dell laptop which was i3 and 4gb ram and was very slow. For any decent use the minimum requirement is i5 with 8gb ram and in this product the SSD, turbo boost and graphics card makes it much faster. Full HD resolution gives super picture quality."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Received this laptop on Friday, n on next day Saturday it didn't boot up, hard disk error. Had to call HP service center, now I'm waiting for the technician to come n seal the device n get some letter before I could approach Amazon for replacement.."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Awesome laptop Good for engineering students.we bought it for my brother's 18th birthday. He is going to go into it so a really good hit. light weight. smooth like butter.*army refrence* go for it
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,Worst product...may be a repaired..keyboard not working properly and Amazon took 1 month for refund after several stress making followups...from my experience If you are going to buy a costly product don't go for online stores..your money will be locked and you will be in struggle .
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"There has been an incorrect description of this product. The display quality of the is really bad and strain to eyes, one can not use for a longer time. Please be watchful before buying it. We did not have the IPS version and opted for the Full HD version but it is nowhere near that. If you are going to use a Laptop screen for primary display purposes, this laptop is not ideal. The description should be fixed ASAP."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Got this laptop delivered fast and was quite excited about the it but, unfortunately it started showing error from day 2. When I submitted for a replacement sellers wanted me to wait for inspection. Now just holding the unused box with me. They have not done the basic quality check before dispatch. Also the laptop was configured months ago even before purchase so I am losing warranty period. Quite disappointed with this purchase"
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"First of all this is a very very good looking laptop. The size is absolutely perfect and the screen is amazing, not anti glare though. The processor does its job without any hiccups and battery gives back-up for 5-5.30 hours. SSD with NVMe interface is very fast and I did not experience any heating issue as such. It comes with MS Windows 10 Home and MS Office with lifetime validity. Overall this will be a good choice for anyone who is looking for a lightweight and compact laptop with amazing performance for work or study purpose."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Do not buy, received laptop today afternoon and stopped working in the evening. Not getting any help from Amazon.  Update: got a replacement laptop on 11 of august which is even worse. Warranty is showing less than year. Warranty start month is April? How is it possible? Definitely a used/refurbished which Amazon is selling at a price of new product. As usual Amazon customer service is of no help even after providing pictures not listening anything. Product description says it has 1 8gb ram and one empty slot is there for expansion but actually it has 2 4 gb rams. If i want to upgrade the ram to 16 gb i have buy 2 8 gb rams instead of one. Keys are already loose and seems like keyboard is used for sometime. Doesn’t appears to be new product. Don’t buy this item from here, you will regret."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,The product is truly awesome. One cons that i observed is during the video calls the laptop heats up higher than usual.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,Battery life extremely poor. Keys are depressed at left and right side. Heats up quickky. Have bought laptops from amazon before but this has been a bad experience.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"I bought this on 4th of july, installed android studio and started running the program through emulator, laptop started stuck. It has 8gm ram i did not expect this behaviour.  I have observed, it is providing more heat. And more over the sound is coming, when u started the emulator.  And return policy is Worst. It has only 7 days of time. If it exceed, then they will never take return.  I have compared hp with lenovo as suggested my cousins and colleagues. Finally i went with hp. Now i am regretting to buy hp."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Bought this laptop for my kids to attend online classes. Fast booting in 10 secs and smooth operation. Compared other brand models in the same range, less features. No fingerprint reader ord keyboard back-light. Sturdy look, Good display."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Within 20 days of usage, the laptop started having problems with the battery, taking 8 to 10 hours for charging and the machine getting overheated. Calls and complaints to Customer Care yielding no response. Disgusting.👎"
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,I received and checked the product almost everything is fine but when I create login credentials it clearly says windows activated in July 2021 and antivirus and other products also about to expire in three days. Iam totally surprised with this. AMAZON ARE U SELLING ME A USED PRODUCT. Quite worried though didn’t find any other issues
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"Other than the heating issue, which is also not that great a problem, I do not see any problem with this laptop. It gets all the work done and quickly, has free Microsoft office Home and Student, FHD screen, and it's super light and handy."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,I liked the laptop. Very light weight and convenient to use. Can go for it if you are looking for an everyday use laptop. Battery performance could be a bit better but in all I like it.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,I got this laptop just today and the processor speed in the laptop mentions as 2.4Ghz and in the product description as 4.3GHz. Mc-caffe antivirus had also expired as soon as the laptop got booted. Looks like a renewed one. Dont go for it.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,The battery backup will remain 4 to 5 hrs and some heating issue there. I bought for 59k and if it may contain fingerprint sensor and anti glare screen would be the best. Performance is good and very light to carry. This lap is best for programmers and students.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,It boots up really fast. 7 seconds to be exact! And it runs all softwares with so much ease. And so fast. bindblowing!!!  It's really worth for the money
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2016tu,laptop,"One month of experience, nothing bad about the product. But 59000/- (amount that I spent) is too much for it. There are better laptops for same process range. Felt somewhat regret after buying it. Hope this may useful to u. And by the way there is return option also for this product."

Dell-Display-Integrated-Graphics-D552166WIN9DE,laptop,"i will review in 3 stages good ,avg and bad  Good: Processor r5 3450u (get your daily work done) ssd 256gb(but u will get around 150-155gb after all necessary updates) screen (no dead pixel and no screen bleeding....brightness can be a issue if you work outside mostly) microphone (captures super crystal voice good for work from home ) easy to carry lightweight laptop and design is also good  Average: build quality (build quality near trackpad is so poor that when you put your palm on palm rest it will click any button of trackpad) camera(just that much that people can recognize you) keyboard(you have to sacrifice with num pad) speaker(my phones speaker is louder than this) trackpad(small in size) dell mobile connect(it is just useless ....believe me you never going to use it )  Bad: Heat(heat is going to be a part of your life...it heat even after 10-15min of browsing ) battery(i dont know why but i was not able to charge my laptop 100%...charging stuck at 91%)  conclusion 1.when you want laptop with ryzen 5 processor +ssd with brand name like dell then only you can consider it and ofcourse you are on tight budget...and it is not for gaming(you can play low end games) 2. attending classes and daily work can be done easily"
Dell-Display-Integrated-Graphics-D552166WIN9DE,laptop,"The product was properly packed. And about the product, if you want a compact laptop with considerable performance, this is the one. The 8GB RAM and the SSD is really making wonders, helping the system load faster irrespective of the application or task. I'm using them for music production which doesn't need much graphics, so in case you're a graphics guy, go for other ones with additional graphic card."
Dell-Display-Integrated-Graphics-D552166WIN9DE,laptop,Performance is excellent. But when I attach my pen tablet for teaching It's hangs And I have to restart several times It may be due to windows 10
Dell-Display-Integrated-Graphics-D552166WIN9DE,laptop,"Dell Vostro 3405 , amd ryzen 5 , 8 gb ram upgradable , 512 ssd. First impression is really good , looks and feel - light and shiny , -Quality of plastic used could be improved , doubt if it can last for years - touch pad is quite responsive, keyboard is excellent boot time is under 10 secs , amazing combination of processor +ssd + windows 10 os+ mcafe av I got 2000k cash back for effective prize came down by 3-4 k including discounts from credit card etc. overall product is amazing at this price point .with upgradable ram upto 16 gb in future , 512 ssd is reasonable bargain at this price . I would recommend this product for general use , with low or little gaming ,or less graphic intensive use . specs are certainly good , but the body is plastic which casts doubts on longevity of device over time and general wear and tear. Above all the support from Dell and Amazon support is great. Thanks"
Dell-Display-Integrated-Graphics-D552166WIN9DE,laptop,"Good laptop for personal use. R5 makes it a good deal at this price range, go for it if your usage is limited to browsing, ms office, light games, OTT. Comes with 1 yr + 90 days McAfee antivirus. No finger print unlock and no backlit keyboard. Overall satisfied with this Dell Vostro 3405 Installation can be done by ourselves, don't go for additional paid service. Warranty, Windows and MS Office can be activated by ourselves, watch youtube videos of this laptop for instructions if you need help otherwise its self explanatory."
Dell-Display-Integrated-Graphics-D552166WIN9DE,laptop,"I have searched more than a month for buying a laptop, and i choose to buy this laptop due to this laptop configuration. It has AMD rysen 5 which is equivalent to the Inter core i5 processor. core i5 processor laptops are more than 50k, but i wanted to purchase the laptop below 50k, so selected this one.  for Processing and configuration wise this laptop is fine, but the material seems like a plastic, lightweight and keyboard also hard to press not smoothly, and appearance is not okay with budget"

Dell-Display-Integrated-Graphics-D552166WIN9DE,laptop,It has been a month I have been using this laptop for some work. Below are the major pros and cons of this laptop: Pros - Excellent battery life - at least 6-7 hours when fully charged - Easy to carry - lightweight - Build quality is great - multitasking is easy - smoother keyboard and boots instantly  Cons - Heats up especially in the beginning - trackpad should be bigger - keyboard is not backlit  Overall it is a good laptop for both personal and commercial purpose.

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1146TX,laptop,Amazing performance good GPU and CPU but not a value of money it has good performance but not as good as 74000. Feeling cheated. Price dropped Rs 4000 within 25 days of purchase.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1146TX,laptop,Everything about this product is similar to a costlier laptop Graphics card Refresh rate Ram Cpu
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1146TX,laptop,"Pros: The build quality is good. Graphics are great. Highly recommended for hardcore gamers who plays by keeping their device in charge.  Cons: Tha battery life is too poor, its lasts for about 2 hours only that too while using low graphic applications. The screen is too worse. My screen was damaged twice, but thanks to HP they offered me 3rd new laptop in the same week one after the other."
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,"Camera quality is bad Good booting speed, u will feel the difference Some keys are compromised on the keyboard cause small size but that's not a big problem  Overall it's amazing laptop 🤩🤩"
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,Overall laptop justify its price but I noticed lacked space it would be atleast 512ssd instead 256ssd storage. Another thing is about camera that seems very poor. In term of performance it is best
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,Camera and battery life can be better. Rest all is very nice and smooth.

The best laptop for students and office work.. looks is fabulous...performance is excellent... sound quality is very good... very fast processor with processor speed 3 ghz .. camera is bit hazy but works fine as most laptops don't provide good cameras... slim and lightweight too.... overall no regret buying this I bought it at 41800 the i3/11th gen version which I found more price worthy than the i5 10th gen... the picture of the camera provided in the normal light...
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,Received it on 29th May 2021.  FHD screen delivers crystal clear picture. Specs are exactly as described. Lightweight and compact. Battery life is good. On standby.... It showed 10hrs..... And during use 4-5 hours. Software avlb as described.  Camera is basic.... Very grainy. Battery is not accessible. Overall very good specs for the Value. Let's wait and see
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,"Writing a review after using it for 3 days. Looks are class. Sleek and elegant. Light weight. Boots in seconds. Has finger print recognition, backlit keyboard. Ms office preloaded which was a feature essential for me. Sound quality perfect. Only downside is the camera which is quite disappointing. So the four stars!"
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,Good specs. The laptop is good for general use and a little bit of coding.. The build quality is good and so is the screen to body ratio and hinge quality. It has a backlit keyboard as well. It also has MS office..
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,"*Overall very good laptop with packed powerhouse, backlit keyboard, superb display. **According to my notice it has some downside like speakers of this laptop is not that loud. Camera is bad, should be better I think, in name of HD they are giving VGA like quality, battery life is average (Not that very good), in I3 11th gen they are giving UHD graphics but they highlighted that it has IRIS Xe, laptop heating not persist for me except when I do MCAFFE antivirus FULL SCAN (maybe its the problem of Mcaffe software), I bought this laptop in PRIME DAY sale for 41990 and in this price company should provide 512GB ssd but it has only 256GB. ***Though every laptop has many downsides, it has least and it is an excellent purchase in term of performance and features, if you can ignore these downsides."

ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,"Everything else is pretty average, although, it is a super choice for regular users who just do browsing and regular basic work. But why spend RS. 45K over this if you have better options like Mi Notebook at the same range with much higher specifications.  The battery life in this laptop is never more than 3-4 hours. I will suggest to go for Mi Notebook if you're willing to spend 45K."
ASUS-i3-1115G4-15-6-inch-Integrated-X513EA-BQ312TS,laptop,"I bought this product through amazon laptop exchange offer , so i returned my asus X555L laptop which was almost 5 years old in exhange. Exchange process was very smooth , delivery excecutive checked general laptop condition and then checked the configuration and was satisfied and handed over my new laptop.  Laptop is good , smooth running laptop, not at all gaming laptop as VRAM is just 128MB, so not recommeneded for gamers. But if u need laptop for work or personal use , its a good deal , with 2.3Ghz i5 11 gen processor , 8 gb Ram , 1tB Hdd its a good deal. Speed is good. Overall 4/5 .

Dell was definitely on top of my list and the price suited my budget. Ryzen 5 works like a dream and it takes just a few seconds to boot, toggling between apps is very smooth. The display is extremely crisp. Sound output could have been a tad bit higher but works for me, I use Bluetooth audio bars anyway. Bluetooth connectivity is impressive.

Working on it for last 3 days they are really sad for the performance of the laptop. 1.)The first issue was very bad webcam quality. Meetings not clear and also difficult for online studies. 2.)Secondly, the screen gets stuck multiple times. 3.)Slow speed while loading screen. I HAD GOOD TRUST ON AMAZON AND MY FAMILY IS NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE LAPTOP. I CHECKED WITH AMAZON SUPPORT AND THEY SAID NO RETURN. I REQUEST THE RESELLER MWIPL, Rajiv Gandhi Chowk, Faridabad, Haryana to refund my money ASAP.(I had lost my job due to covid hence good people please support me)"
HP-Laptop-366C6PA-Ryzen-3-3250U,laptop,This not good product very bad
HP-Laptop-366C6PA-Ryzen-3-3250U,laptop,"I'm writing review after 10 days :  Battery backup mentioned is 10 hours , but it lasts 3-4h only on average use. Keys are not upto the point ,one of the key (f1) come out of the keyboard while using. Keys quality is poor.  Look, display and performance is good for average use. I have dual boot this laptop & using linux and windows simultaneously . didn't face any performance issue. Just little lags happens sometimes.  Its overall good for coding and Online study in this price range . If you want better performance just upgrade it with ssd and 4gb more ram as it has extra slots And it becomes ready for Normal gaming.  under 30k buget, you can go for it ."
HP-Laptop-366C6PA-Ryzen-3-3250U,laptop,For smooth experience install SSD and More RAM.. Battery life is around 4 Hours.. It Have amd 3300U processor..
HP-Laptop-366C6PA-Ryzen-3-3250U,laptop,Its a value for money laptop. Processor is amd ryzen 3 -3300. Work like a charm with my window 10 pro.
HP-Laptop-366C6PA-Ryzen-3-3250U,laptop,Bad because its webcam doesn't work and and touchpad gets off after 2 3 days and it gets hang time and time
HP-Notebook-245-G7-ATHLON-3050U,laptop,Super original product.  True OS (Win10) and Office 365.  True product. Slim 😊😊😊  Weightless to handle. True HD (but min 720p).  Developes inbuilted mic and webcam.  Webcam rate 4.99/5.  Excellent....
HP-Notebook-245-G7-ATHLON-3050U,laptop,"This is I am using for daily activities like Call ,games , Interview. It's good product with low cost and battery stand by 4 hours maximum in any mood."
HP-Notebook-245-G7-ATHLON-3050U,laptop,Awesome...  Camera quality is good and faster speed of working progress..  Easy to access office 365(ms office)  Internet speed of process also quite good.. not hanging or slow..  Totally perfect for medium use.
HP-Notebook-245-G7-ATHLON-3050U,laptop,"I bought this laptop recently for general use, nothing advanced. It is sleek, and lightweight. That also means that it is slightly delicate, so beware.  Performance wise, the AMD processor caters to basic use, and for running software which is not too heavy on the processor. If you want a laptop to use Office apps, watch films and browse the internet, this would work quite well.  The display is good, nothing special there.  If you haven't already read the specifications, note that the laptop doesn't come with a CD Drive.  Battery backup is fairly good. The speakers are average, so is the camera.  One main concern would be the heating. The laptop heated up unusually highly for a new laptop, but that hasn't caused any major issues.  Overall, it's worth the price, as long as you don't expect too much."
HP-Notebook-245-G7-ATHLON-3050U,laptop,Value for money... Can add up to 16gigs of ddr4 3200mhz ram Slot for m.2 SSD available 🤑

HP-Notebook-245-G7-ATHLON-3050U,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Hanging issue. If you are going to use this laptop for professional work, never buy this one. If you run 3 to 4 applications at the same time, its automatically gonna stop working, screen freezes once in a day. Then you have to shutdown the system forcefully, because no keys are gonna work.  So ,as per my suggestion try not to buy this laptop if you are looking for professional work."

Initially HP diagnosed this to be a motherboard issue. It was replaced with a new unit, it had the same issue. So, basically the model is flawed. It would be better for HP to withdraw this product."

Dell-Vostro-3400-Integrated-D552184WIN9BE,laptop,"To begin with, the Intel 11th Gen chips on its 10nm process is the biggest upgrade intel has rocked in more than half a decade. While each generation has a modest 5% improvement over the previous, the 11th Gen. Laptop chips are more to the order of 20% (something for which AMD is to be thanked more than Intel!)  This processor is the fastest* you can (currently) have in a laptop (*except the Apple's M1, which is a different beast altogether, if you know what you're dealing with). Even the same generation i7 has such a small margin of improvement over this one, that one might excuse it for being statistically insignificant.  Nonetheless, with that settled in, raises the important question:  WHY IS THIS LAPTOP SO AWFULLY SLOW?  The question is.. very, very valid. Just check the other reviews. This laptop lags more than my 7 year old desktop. And the reason, for the failure of this laptop with TOTL processor & DDR4 memory & latest Xe graphics..  No points for guessing, it uses a hard disk. Yes, that thing bottlenecks *so* *bad*. It's awful. It's unusable. While the processor can crunch numbers like Turing's second awakening, the hard disk takes you back to the 20th century. The first day I received it, I was tearing my hair, drank myself to sleep, sobbing over all the decisions I had made in life that led to this moment.  But to the rescue comes the most wondrous invention of the 21st century besides TikTok: The NVMe SSD. This butch laptop of ours has an empty M.2 NVMe slot; same as its more expensive variants, just that they come with this slot non-empty. Long story short, I upgraded to an NVMe and installed my OS of choice (hey, Windows folks, that OS will forever be a bottleneck), and this is the fastest PC I've ever laid my hands on. (maybe because I never got hold of an M1 macbook, but nonetheless..)  tl;dr: do yourself a favor and upgrade to an NVMe SSD, they're cheap these days. Or spend double the difference to get the upgraded model. In any case, it's literally a millenia of difference. Without it, this shackled beast will only remind you of the good ole' 20th century days."

Lenovo-82C700D4IH-Laptop-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Not so fast. You'll probably need to add more RAM later that could cost you 1500 for another 4gb. Overall it's fine for the price. Design is good.
Lenovo-82C700D4IH-Laptop-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,There's no OS. Also the product cannot be returned once you discover that you have been delivered a shell (a machine with no OS)

(Please make a note that this laptop is not a gaming laptop so one can't play high end games on it and Video Editing Softwares Like Adobe Premiere Pro will lag and not run smoothly as they are quiet heavy softwares)...

Dell-i3-1005G1-Integrated-Graphics-D552151WIN9BE,laptop,It is a compact 14-inch laptop with lined-texture whole outside. Sound quality and loudness is good. Boot up time is good. Only drawback is brightness management. Even 50% brightness level is not enough sometimes. Pages and new windows open with a less contrast and then in 3-5 seconds it adjusts contrast and becomes normal. I think Dell should fix this. Apart from this it is a good laptop.
Dell-i3-1005G1-Integrated-Graphics-D552151WIN9BE,laptop,Very good product but very bad customer service by amazon very rude behaviour

Dell-i3-1005G1-Integrated-Graphics-D552151WIN9BE,laptop,Seller: Appario Retail Price: approx. ₹39k. Loved the way this product was gift wrapped! Totally worth the extra ₹s for the gift wrapping & personalized b-day card from Amazon! 👏🏼 The product was packed nicely within a really tight cardboard box 📦. It took a good 10 minutes just to open the box! But the product is really good 👍🏼. It's runs smoothly without any hassles. The 256 GB SSD makes all applications run fast without any lag in performance. Warranty is upto September 2022 (a little more than a year). The keyboard layout sucks! The arrow keys are too small. The bottom bezel of the screen is around 2 inches! The overall design is bad. It's a bit heavy to carry. But the laptop works smoothly. It is a premium product from DELL. Go for it!

Dell-Inspiron-Generation-Microsoft-998-ENDP,laptop,I dont know what exactly the problem is. Neither the software nor the build quality reflect the quality we expect from Dell. Touch pad is damaged within 1 month of usage. No after delivery support from Amazon. Really thinking of dropping amazon purchase hereafter
Dell-Inspiron-Generation-Microsoft-998-ENDP,laptop,Liked the colour( grey- Slim and handy to use.Battery is not heavy with good battery backup. Screen quality pretty good. Brought for my daughter for online classes 1 month ago and there are not issues. Nothing really to dislike- The panel on the exterior gets stained - personal experience.

Dell-Inspiron-Generation-Microsoft-998-ENDP,laptop,Awesome Laptop loved it. Just nice l. Thank you Amazon for the prompt response and quick delivery.
Dell-Inspiron-Generation-Microsoft-998-ENDP,laptop,"Product was received in time and also in perfect condition. On second day we observed issue with Key Board of laptop and now we have registered service request with Dell and waiting for update. This is really frustrating. If we buy offline, vendor provide service immediately and problem is resolved. I bought first time online and regret my decision. I would strongly suggest not to purchase online to have problems like this ( particularly when you are procuring for offices or business purpose ). Dell now informed us that particular part is missing hence we need to wait till part comes and they will replace it. We are unable to use this laptop till date. DO NOT PURCHASE."
Dell-Inspiron-Generation-Microsoft-998-ENDP,laptop,"We people always think that amazon service items and service good. Amazon is less careful about what u purchased!!!!!! Whether its costly or cheap, no body is there to kpi their provider about the product. I need you to return the laptop which is already degrading, blinking and restarting by itself. I hope people who are planning to buy will be wisely on purchasing here"
Dell-Inspiron-Generation-Microsoft-998-ENDP,laptop,"Overall its decent product for kids, students, home use & general browsing & usage. Physical appearance is very sober with matt finish & anti glare matt screen. Its light weight too. However, its slow to boot up & takes time to load some heavy applications. I would not recommend usage for work professional who need speed & multi app working. But, given the attractive price its worth buying."
Dell-Inspiron-Generation-Microsoft-998-ENDP,laptop,"Extremely dissapointed!!! I have been a regular customer of Amazon which is why I spent 45K and got this laptop, turns out I have been handed over with a delicate toy that has started giving me issues after not more than a month of its purchase!! I haven't used it everyday, have been very careful still it's giving me issues like taking around 1.5 hours to refresh!!!!  What nonsense is this Amazon???"

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-3550H-15-ec0101AX,laptop,"Don't buy it from amazon, The laptop is great but it has someone else ID before you login and It has only 8 months of warranty left.Buy it from flipkart."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-3550H-15-ec0101AX,laptop,"So I bought this product and using it for 10 days. It takes 2-3 minutes to boot which is very long for a Gaming Laptop. All apps/software takes some time to start. Even when you open file explorer and if you have files more than 10 it will take time to process. Battery is avg but I don't expect also as it is a gaming laptop. Tried to run Graphic intensive software (AutoCAD, Premiere Pro) and it is not good.  Then I contacted Amazon for replacement but after their checkup with an technician they denied. Let's hope maybe HP will help me.  Will keep you updated."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-3550H-15-ec0101AX,laptop,Design is good and uniqe. But that's not we only look in the laptop. it's performance is little slow because it has no ssd. Booting time is little longer. Overall it's not a laptop you want in 55k there can be a better options.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-3550H-15-ec0101AX,laptop,The product I received was heating up a lot. I was only using chrome and the laptop would start heating up within 30 mins. The charging brick would also heat up within 10 mins. The laptop would heat up extremely when charging. Buy with caution. I have asked for a refund. Waiting for the cashback.

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-3550H-15-ec0101AX,laptop,"This is the ryzen 5 version of hp pavilion gaming laptop over here... . Really a great laptop if you can install an m2 ssd as it significantly improves the performance. I am giving this review after 1 month of usage.  -Exceptionally good performance, even with 100s of chrome tabs open and multimedia in the background. - Secondly, the laptop is really very fast in booting up with only 3sec booting time. (Only for SSD version) - I haven't really faced any issues since 1month. Its an amazing laptop no doubt about it. Just go for it.  Coming to the disadvantages, there are two. Though it does not affect me significantly.  -One, it has 60hz screen refresh rate. Which might not be enough for hardcore gamers -Second, the webcam is not really nice but it is not really horrible either. -Lastly the build quality isn't that great, but not an issue as I am only going to use it on my desk.  Battery backup is 7 hours in normal use, the full time is 3 to 3½ hours with video and 2 to 2 and a half hours if you talk within the game."

ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1115G4-Integrated-X415EA-EK342TS,laptop,"First of all, the product images in amazon are not totally accurate. The images show a black keyboard with white letters and no fingerprint reader within trackpad. Actual product has silver colored keys with grey letter and there is a fingerprint reader. Refer ASUS official website for correct pics.  Things I liked: - Light weight - Bootup and shutdown speeds are good. - Fast fingerprint reader. - Good loud speakers. - Premium look.  Things that could have been better.. - Display (Viewing angles are not that great. And I observed blue tint. Not sure if this is good for long sessions. I will have to find out. - Keyboard (You cant see the letters on the keys from certain angles or lighting conditions. You will have to lean forward to see the letters. A black keyboard with white letters would have been better) - Camera (Not at all good or I can say useless. I will give 1 out of 5 ratings for Camera) - Left and Right click buttons make cheap clicky sound.  Overall I am happy with the product. Giving 4 stars instead of 5, only for the bad camera."

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I purchased the HP Pavillion Gaming 15-ec1024AX during the prime day sale for around 59k. According to my testing and comparing it to other laptops in the price range, I can confidently say that this is easily the most powerful laptop under 60k. CPU: The amd ryzen 5 4600h is an absolute price to performance beast and this CPU alone makes this PC worth buying. It's performance is even better than the intel i7 10750h which is usually found in laptops above 1 lakh (see Cinebench scores below for CPU performance). GPU: The Nvidia Geforce gtx 1650 is pretty good for this price range and is definitely a better deal than the 1650ti which is priced around 10k more with a performance bump of only around 7%. (For more details about GPU performance see the Unigine Heaven and Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmarks below). Thermals: The thermals were actually better than I expected. In all my benchmarks and stress tests the CPU temps rarely crossed 90 degrees C and the GPU temps are much lower (around 70 degrees C). You can see the thermal design with 2 heat pipes and two fans. Also the intake (underside) and exhaust (rear) vents are pretty large, which allows for good airflow. Even at max performance the fans don't get very loud. Unfortunately there is no software to manually control the fan speed, but I think I'm asking for too much at this price range. Display: The IPS LCD display seems pretty good to me and viewing angles are excellent. The peak brightness is more than enough indoors, but I haven't tested it outdoors. I don't know about NTSC or sRGB values, but the colours look good to my eyes. Miscellaneous: RAM is 8GB 3200MHz single-channel with one slot free. This is perfect for me because I want to upgrade to 16GB, but for those who don't want to upgrade, the lack of dual channel RAM could be a negative. The installed hard drive is terrible, like all hard drives (see Crystaldiskmark scores). On the bright side, the laptop supports upto 1TB of M.2 NVMe SSD storage. I have installed a 250GB NVMe SSD and it made a HUGE difference. (Boot time reduced from 40secs to under 10secs). The process of transferring windows to the SSD and making it the boot drive is a little complicated, but you can always get it done by a professional. I HIGHLY recommend upgrading to an SSD, without it performance is quite sluggish. I cannot say anything about the battery life because I haven't tested it yet. The keyboard is excellent. It has two levels of white backlighting (much better than violet IMO) and it has a numpad which is a necessity for me. The only problem is that the arrow keys are squished together. Build is all plastic, but has a clean and understated look (I hate obnoxious GAMERY aesthetics). The build feels pretty sturdy but one major problem is that it picks up fingerprints like crazy and it is pretty tough to clean (see pictures).  Now here's some data from the benchmarks I ran. I have given results for both while charging and on battery: CPU Z (Charging): CPU Bench: Single thread: 490.0 Multi thread: 4021.7 Multi thread ratio: 8.21 CPU Stress: 5 min CPU Max temp: 90.9°C CPU Max power: 50.9W  CPU Z (Battery): CPU Bench: Single thread: 479.5 Multi thread: 2440.5 Multi thread ratio: 5.09 CPU Stress: 5 min CPU Max temp: 74.0°C CPU Max power: 30.8W  Cinebench R20 (Charging): Single core score: 454 Multi core score: 3400 MP ratio: 7.48  Cinebench R20 (Battery): Single core score: 446 Multi core score: 2822 MP ratio: 6.32  Unigine Heaven 4.0 (Charging): DirectX11, high quality, normal tesselation, 1080p Score: 1772 Avg framerate: 70.4FPS Max framerate: 138.6FPS Min framerate: 19.1FPS GPU stable clock: 1785MHz GPU max power: 50.9W GPU max temp: 63°C  Unigine Heaven 4.0 (Battery): DirectX11, high quality, normal tesselation, 1080p Score: 1385 Avg framerate: 55.0FPS Max framerate: 125.6FPS Min framerate: 16.9FPS GPU stable clock: 1500MHz GPU max power: 31.5W GPU max temp: 53°C  Crystaldiskmark: Default, 5 cycles, 1GiB HDD: Sequential read: 127.5MB/s Random read: 1.3MB/s Sequential write: 122.4MB/s Random write: 1.1MB/s SSD: (not included, bought separately) Sequential read: 2034.4MB/s Random read: 857.0MB/s Sequential write: 1263.0MB/s Random write: 1046.5MB/s  Blender BMW (Charging): CPU: Time: 4m8s CPU max temp: 93.8°C CPU max power: 53.4W GPU: Time: 2m38s GPU max temp: 58°C GPU max power: 43.1W  Blender BMW(Battery): CPU: Time: 5m5s CPU max temp: 68.5°C CPU max power: 32.2W GPU: Time: 3m46s GPU max temp: 54°C GPU max power: 30.7W  Shadow of the tomb raider (Charging): (see settings in pic) Avg framerate: 69FPS CPU max temp: 84.4°C CPU max power: 29.1W GPU max temp: 70°C GPU max power: 50.8W  Shadow of the tomb raider (Battery): (see settings in pic) Avg framerate: 58FPS CPU max temp: 65°C CPU max power: 15W GPU max temp: 56°C GPU max power: 30.5W"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This review is after 10 months. I am a software engineer and I use this laptop for hours a day. Pros: 1. Powerful processor,it is a beast! Easy multitasking. Usually I use IDE s, MS Teams, browsers, emulators together. But it never hangs! It's smooth. 2. Light weight, feels like an ultrabook. 3. Good design , nice premium look. 4. Good battery life , 8+ hours when it is in power saver mode and just browsing. 5. Upgradeable ram. 6. Nvme SSD option. 7. Perfect keyboard, this keyboard is better than those in much more expensive models. 8. Very thin bezels. 9. There is a superspeed C.  Cons: 1. Ram in this laptop is 8gb ddr4, but very poor quality.(samsung ram 21 GBps read speed) 2. Average speakers. 3. No ssd , nvme ssd can be added. It's pathetic with given hdd . It hangs as hdd usage becomes 100 whenever you open something.Takes 50 sec to boot up and again 2-3 minutes to come into action. Never think to use it without nvme ssd. 4. Overall build quality is average.  Note: 60Hz display Samsung 970 Evo plus nvme ssd works fine with this ! You need to buy it seperately. With that you get complete potential of this laptop. I am using it. There is only one 2.0 and one 3.0 port and one C."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Bought this on Amazon Day. There are only 2 items during that time and this 1 while not perfect is a good buy in my opinion. AMD 4th Gen is much2x faster than Intel I7-8565 (my old laptop) and based on articles also faster compared to I7-10th Gen. 8GB is enough for day to day and GTX1650 is enough for game. Display is marvelous, backlit keyboard helpful a lot as I need to see where I type :). I do upgrade the HDD with M2 SSD and installation is a breeze. Just open 7 screws and access to the slot is covered only by a sticker."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I bought this laptop in prime day sale at 59990. Got it before the scheduled delivery day. Our budget was initially 55000 but later rose to 60000. To be honest I needed a laptop which can run high graphics softwares. But was an amateur in the technical field. I researched about each and everything for about 2 days to get a better understanding of the hardware. After getting the basic ideas and information, I researched both the online and offline market to get a proper view of price to product ratio of the respected field. The only thing which caught my eye was the 4600H. I researched about it and made up of mind to chose it. I would divide it between Pros and Cons:- Pros:- 1. The Ryzen 5 4600H:- the best one which can you get for the price bracket. In layman's language, the smoothness and the advantages you can get from this chip, would be similar to somewhat 80K laptop. It's even better than the ryzen 7 processors in some fields. It can also easily outperform the i5 9th gen which is same or more costly than it or somewhat outperform the i7 10th gen. Quite nice, isn't it?  2. The battery backup is very good. Continuously played GTA V and it gave a backup time of 4 hrs and 13 mins. Worked on video editing on filmora and premier pro and gave a backup of 8 hrs.  3. Battery charges very quickly. From 0 to 100 it took around 57 mins as the adapter is of 150 watt.  4. Light weight. It's quite light comparing to other products in this price range except the nitro 5.  5. The graphics of 1650 embedding with the processor gives out very good results. Cons:- 1. Ram is of Samsung which can be a downgrade because it doesn't clock the required MHz. But it can be upgraded by using a better ram in another slot.  2. HDD is provided which is slow in processing. Again it can be rectified by installing another SSD.  3. Webcam is not at all HD. It's a major con as it was written HD but it seems like VGA.  4. The build quality could have been better. It's not upto HP standards.  Conclusion:-  You can go for it blindly if your main concerns are not webcam clarity, SSD, screen resolution!  Hope you liked my review! If found Helpful, don't forget to click the helpful button! Your one click can bring a smile on one's face! Cheers! Stay safe❤️ Happy choosing!"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I bought this laptop on 7th when I started using it hangs a lot, opening a simple browser it hangs, without installing anything in the disk, it consumes almost 100% disk usage. How could this happened, this is a defected piece. I have contacted Amazon customer care services, many times for replacement they are not providing any technical support. This first time I bought electronically item on Amazon they are not giving me any technical support, how could you expect next order from my side. I want a replacement, send me technical support."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Writing after 1 month use. Good performace. I upgraded it with a 256 kingston ssd and it loads fast. Boot time is around 3-4 seconds. Battery is around 2.5-3 hrs with average usage. (Photoshop, Chrome and spotify running). Charges quickly. Sometimes i feel a little freeze in photoshop, But i havent yet diagnosed it whether its a system issue or my wacom issue. So cant complain. This is a 45% NTSC device. So colour accuracy is not that great. I was wrong about thinking it has around 75% sRGB. It has lower than that. Maybe around 55-62% sRGB. So digital artists and graphic designers, think twice or get a decent monitor along(as im planning to). The screen has a yellow slight tint overall sometimes. Im not a gamer, So dont know about that. I bought it for my professional use. Overall this is a very good buy. Cheers."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"The performance is so good after installing the ssd, if u r thinking using this laptop without ssd then just don't buy it, that's what i suggest from my experience. Overall good for gaming."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I got it for 60k during prime days sale. There's nothing wrong with the device, but I think not researching and rushing to buy a product coz I needed it urgently wasn't a really wise move. The Hard disk on the laptop is a bottleneck and I installed an SSD so the whole thing cost me around 63k, but the thing is, as of now this is selling for 65.5, this extra 5.5k is clearly too much. I would say to go with ASUS which is offering their TUF lineup which is nearly identical to this except, it already has an NVMe SSD and 144Hz Display, and the RAM can be expanded to 32GB instead of 16 GB like this one. It even has a better keyboard layout with RGB controls.  I am not having any problem with this machine, but even if you get it on the price I got it, you would be spending around 60000 at least. While ASUS model number FA506IH-AL047T is going on sale RIGHT NOW for 61000 with a much better screen and a pre-installed SSD which is very necessary if you want to get the full performance of this processor. So instead of going for this and spending at least 63000 bucks, just go with the ASUS one. Don't repeat my mistake.  Now, if for some reason you have made up your mind that you don't wanna buy ASUS, go ahead. I don't think there's anyone apart from ASUS who can beat this at this price point, and you are going to have a great experience no doubt, but the only thing is, that machine can give a much better value for your money than this, especially for gamers, as a higher refresh rate screen will be much more suitable in a gaming laptop."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,So this is my second hp laptop after 2015. I got this laptop at 58.5k and it was an amazing deal to get ryzen 5 4600h and nvidia GTX 1650. The pricing of somewhat similar laptop at offline market was 70k and above. Pros. 1. Ryzen 5 4600h 2. GTX 1650 3. Great display color 4. Performance is up to the point 5. In budget with web camera at top 6. Build quality is great 7. Battery capacity is good (haven't done gaming but other heavy load) 8. Cooling is good 9. Feels primium  Cons. 1. No ssd (had to upgrade) 2. 60hz display (but u can't expect 144hz at this price)
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Powerful Laptop 1.98Kg But you have to do optimization Factory settings won't unleash this beast Normal Usage laptop battery life will be 5-6HRs battery Video streaming : 4Hrs Weight distribution ok but Display side still whopping effect there. Battery charging little bit slow Speaker Good but not Great Display quality in door was great. Key board was nice but touchpad needs some tuning. Webcam Medicore
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I got this laptop 2 days ago, been playing games non stop like.... 10 hours. There is no heating issue. The charge usually lasts 4 hours if you are playing hardcore games. The keyboard is okay but I disliked the function keys which are very veeeery small. Hqrd to press them if you are plating MOBA. This pc comes with an in built recorder of some kind, haven't tried it yet, will try it after buying a mic and update the review. If you are asking me to get it or not, I'd simply close my four eyes and say YES  7th months have passed, using this on a daily basis without any issues. Wfh has been fun with this thing... I can work and play games during work 😂🤣😂"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"pros ------ Ryzen 4600H 1650 graphics card display looks great build quality feels sturdy Edit-- heat management is great, no heating even on continuous usage  cons ----- even at max volume speaker is okayish at best Battery life around 4-5 hours on medium usage, without gaming Edit-- goes through complete day of WFH with a single charge (including 2-3 hours of online calls,and being connected to vpn whole day) with 30% battery left at end. maybe battery needs 2-3 charge cycles to give optimum performance.  going to add a 500 GB ssd on it, let's see how it goes Edit------ Added crucial 500gb ssd, now booting time has reduced to 10 sec max and there isn't any lag after booting . Will suggest anyone facing lagging to install a ssd and boot from it."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Okay, so after researching for about 1 month I finally decided to buy a laptop which can satisfy all my basic needs as well as some video editing and gaming...  Boy I tell you this is without a doubt the best laptop you can get under 60k forget about acer nitro or asus tuf... I am extremely satisfied with the product.. ordered on 20th of August and got delivered on 24th with decent packing... Inside the box was the main beast.. a charger and user manual..  It took about 15-20 minutes to set up and has been working flawlessly since...  Let me get straight to the point now... You see all laptop within the range of 50-75k come with 1650 or 1650ti and perhaps some with 1050ti... So the graphics quality is clearly amazing.. on top of that while most laptop feature a i5 9th gen or ryzen5 3000s this comes with ryzen 5 4600H which is absolutely a beast having 6 core and 12 threads.. capable to run even the most demanding software and without a doubt all games and even those who are to come in near future....  Have seen some people complaining about slow loading time... I agree the loading time isn't what ud expect but nonetheless a ssd will just pump your system and make it go perfectly flawless.. the ram too should be upgraded to 16 gb and that's the sweet spot... Also just a reminder that you'll be needing m.2 nvme ssd and 3200hz ram don't install a ram any lower as it will not be beneficial... Talking about the screen it's very nice ips 1080p with a decent color production... Some people complain it's only 60 hz but that's actually good as most of the games won't run on above 70 fps so no need to look for a 120 hz screen.... And if you really are all about gaming then prefer having a desktop instead with rtx 2060 or GTX 1660ti as they are perfect beasts as of now... (THOUGH BETTER CARDS ARE ABOUT TO BE RELEASED)...  Everything else works nice and good  Overall I have zero complaints and am extremely satisfied with what I've got... Also 10/10 goes to speaker backlit keyboard and etc  The only possible upgrade from hp could have been giving 2 usb 3.0 slots instead of one... That's the only otherthing I could have considered...  Just to end the review...im gonna tell some benchmarks So Witcher 3 - HiGh to Ultra combo 60 Fps average  Far cry 5 - High to Ultra 60 Fps constant with some minor stuttering due to ram limitation  Have only these games yet will upload more as I donwload others.  Overall a must buy"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"First of all i rated it 4 because of the packaging done by amazon seller is too bad.  The laptop has ryzen 4000 series cpu and 4 gb gtx 1650 gpu. The performance of the laptop is amazing . The boot time is around 30 sec including login. The camera seems pretty fine.  Display : 4/5 The quality of display is good and it has 60 hz refresh rate. The brightness is sufficient to work even in daylight and colors are also good.  Keyboard: 5/5 There is no flex in the keyboard, size is sufficient for good typing, it has white backlight which looks awesome.  Processor: 5/5 The processor is pretty fast as it provide base clock speed of 3ghz . There is nog lag during any work or software that you use.  Graphics: 5/5 At this price 4gb graphics are amazing. You could play any game in it at max setting and can get 50fps above.  Looks: 5/5 The looks of the laptop are amazing . The black finishing is 😍. But remember the lappy is a fingerprint magnet😑.  Charging: 5/5 This laptop charges fully in 1.5 hrs approx .  Build Quality: 4/5 The quality of plastic used seems of good quality.  Battery backup: 4.5/5 The battery backup seems pretty good. During normal use it works for 6hrs approx at gaming nearly 3 hrs which is a good thing.  Note: i got a error during 1st login but it could easily be sort out. I suggest just go for it. I bought it for 58.5k."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Worst laptop in the world,do not buy this laptop.I will take hours to set up and it takes 5-10 second to open a simple software like Chrome.You can't open a big game as it is so slow."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,For students it may be not the best laptop
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Received an used product with missing charger. After endless calls with Amazon couldn't yield any results. Atlast got response after emailing jeff bezos. They arranged me for a charger. However finally happy. The laptop is an all-rounder with extreme high performance coupled with a terribly slow hdd. The reason so many people complainting here as slow laptop is due to this. The performance can be increased n times just by installing a 256 gb nvme ssd and transferring the os into ssd.  Edit: Added 500gb kingston ssd and 8gb 3200mhz ram from adata. Now this thing is like a rocket. If anyone is seeing this review, adding ssd is a must."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Very great device for the price. Pros: 1) Processor is powerful 2) Graphic card is good enough to run most games at 60fps (med-high settings) 3) Battery backup is good 4) 8gb RAM @3200mhz is good 5) Brightness is good indoors (not suitable for outdoor use) 6) Good design helps to dissipate heat generate quickly while playing games (max temp - 80°C while playing)  Cons: 1) Only 2 USB A ports 2) No SSD/NVMe drive (it does have a slot to add one card later)
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,If you’re looking for casual gaming this is for you ! It doesn’t have RGB backlit just the simple one warzone is not playable However gta v and csgo runs easily. Battery could’ve been better but since it’s a gaming laptop as they say it’s fine
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"**packaging was terrible, a large open( broken seal, wide open ) cardboard box appeared, the laptop was rattling at the bottom, no buble wrap or airbag cushioning.  *Not being very technical , I needed a 'laptop' ( not a desk top ) for video editing and casual gaming. This is the best option available now at this price range ( 60k INR ) that rovides the best balance of both worlds.  *6 cores and 12 threads impressed me a lot with a base freq. Of 3ghz and boost upto 4ghz. ( Best CPU under 60k ).  *GTX 1650 feels like water, when the GPU market looks like a burning desert and laptops with better graphics cards laugh at your pocket.  1. Horrible hard drive ( too slow ) , slow booting and performance. SSD strongly recommended , Good thing is empty slot provided for SSD.  2. 8 gb RAM ( 3200 mhz. ) is ok , upgrade to 16 gb dual channel and you're good to go.  3. ( with Stock hardware ) :  Editing experience of 1080p videos is buttery smooth on premier pro. It takes around 4-5 min. To render a 5 min 1080p video with a lot of text animation , effects and color correction.  Edited some 4k videos , works well ( can't scrub through timeline with all the effects and edits, plays smoothly in full resolution though ). Renders a 5 min 4k video with all effects in 10 mins. ( Approx. ).  4. Display is good , viewing angles are ok. Color accuracy is close to my LG color accurate IPS monitor but not completely reliable for colour correction.  5. Entry level gaming is great. All popular games run properly , watch some youtube reviews before buying this laptop for gaming.  6. Looks good. More like a office laptop with practical design. Keyboard backlight is white ( not purple or pink ) , built quality is very "" HP "" -ish. Built well but bare minimum plastic construction.  7. Windows 10 👍  8. Okay battery and a beautiful charger."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Looks great Works even better Build quality is good Display is good Happy with the product
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"<UPDATED> So I uninstalled the McAfee antivirus and the performce looks better. P.S I still am using HDD  Body - Its plastic but looks nice. The matt finish gives it a premium look  Battery - Good  Display - VERY poor, the color accuracy is pretty bad and the brightness. You won't notice anything unless you're a photo editor. The only essential downside for me.  CPU - THE BEST. The only reason I chose this laptop is because of this hexa core 7nm processor. You cant find a better one in this price segment.  Storage - Very poor. One star less due to this. They should have provided an SSD. Atleast a 128GB one. Moreover, they claimed HDD to be of 7200rpm but its of 5400rpm(Seagate). Its too slow.  Graphic card - Best in price segment.  Ram - Good. 3200MHZ ram with 7+ GB available out of 8GB. The OS consumes around 50% of the ram. Be ready to buy another 8GB RAM if you want very smooth experience.  Gaming - Played AC odessey with High graphics and its buttery smooth. No lags nothings. Played for 30 min. Fans worked wonderfully and the max temperature was around 60°C of GPU (checked from task manager). 55FPS in bechmark test of the game.  Packaging and Delivery - Worst ever. Never expected this from Amazon. The box was poorly packaged and I ordered on 6th Aug and received today (19th August).  Price - The best. I got the best deal ever. It was 60k at prime day sale. With my ICICI amazon pay credit card my effective price was 56k.  Also amazon is fooling people. The same laptop is available at HP website with a different model number and the MRP there is 62k including bag. And all specifications are same.  Sound - Ok Ok  Keyboard - Ok. Not very good. The placement of backspace looks odd. The keyboard is full one but from the middle it looks a little bumped which is a very poor design. My typing speed is above average but I faced issues in typing on this at good pace.  You won't find a better deal than this laptop in this price so buy this blindly.  Let me know if you wanna know something specific Insta/swarnveer"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"The build quality of the laptop is very poor. When holding it you feel how cheap the quality is especially the lid. Build feels more like a 30k laptop. You can damage it easily if not careful. Power button turned flimsy after use. Hinge is a bit wobbly. The screen is vibrant but too dim. Can't see anything in outdoor lighting. It comes with genuine windows 10 and a lot of bloatware. HP apps take up lot of ram and some of them can't be installed. Big LED on the power button is so annoying when using in the dark. Also eats up battery, can't be turned off. Battery life is good, will last upto 3.5 hours with moderate usage. Charges quickly. Touchpad quality is bad, makes sound as if it's loose. Keyboard quality is good. The combination of ryzen 5 4600h and GTX 1650 is good. Runs most games and software smoothly, consider adding an SSD and RAM. Thermals are bad, the right side of the keyboard heats up while moderate to heavy usage. Speaker output is good. Overall the build quality is poor, the software is buggy(drivers and bloatware). Thermals are poor. Good keyboard, speaker. Verdict: buy if you use laptop indoors and don't move it often, for casual gaming, multimedia and work. Don't buy if you use laptop outdoors or travel with it; not for heavy gaming.  Update: noticed backlight bleeding from top of the screen after 3 months of use.  Update after 1 year of use: Hard disk performance has decreased over time, keeps lagging even during browsing. Even normal he's take lot of time to load. Occasionally the games crash. Hinge is more wobbly now. Regretting this buy."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I purchased this model(59,240 Rs) after doing an intense research on YouTube, Amazon reviews. My primary aim was to get Asus tuf A15 base model which has same specs as this but it comes with 512GB SSD and with slightly lower price tag(57K) I had to buy this laptop because Asus tuf was unavailable since long time. I wanted Ryzen 5 4000 series only due to its performance and multitasking abilities compared to i5-10th gen. I will divide this into pros and cons- Pros : 1)Design of laptop is decent , it's not flamboyant as Acer nitro or Too basic as Acer aspire 7. 2) Build quality , feel and finish is upto mark. At this budget , we can get upto this only because there's much more available in performance. If you want good looking, metal body laptop, go for Lenovo S540 or Asus vivobook. 3) Weight of this gaming laptop is not that heavy. It's bearable. 4) Keyboard is decent. Although RGB is missing, the white/purple(depending on model you get) is usable and good looking 5) I have checked performance , it's good while playing games. I have played GTA 5(60fps), CS GO(120-150FPS) , Rocket league(100FPS) , Valorent (150-200FPS) . It's good while we are in game.  Cons: 1) Major problem is its HDD(1TB) . This specific 15-EC1024AX model only comes with 1TB and no SSD. Booting time, app loading + opening time is very high considering this is 2020 and other laptops of same price do the same task in 1/10th time. Although gaming performance is good, the loading time is so high that you will regret buying this. You will have to get external SSD in this laptop's slot. And also whole windows OS is needed to be re-installed in order to get upto today's performance marks. Go for higher model 15-EC1052AX(66,000 for now) 2) Screen is not good , although you would have observed this in many YouTube reviews also, at this price asus is offering 144Hz display. This laptop's one higher model is also being offered with 144hz, this should have gotten that screen 3)Edges around laptop body are quite sharp. If you keep it on table of knee height, you can mistakenly get cut after htting knee on it. 4) HP omen comman center just shows CPU+GPU status. No control over the hardware unlike asus, acer laptops of competition. 5)At 60K price point, there is not much quality in Web cam. They brand it as 720p HD and all but in reality it's like Nokia or Micromax old mobile camera. Not of much use except regular Video calls & meetings.  Verdict : Decent package against highly unavailable Asus tuf a15 base model, but you can't ignore it's HDD only issue . Go for it but make sure to get an SSD attached after purchasing for utilising its complete potential of performance."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Overview: It is a no nonsense laptop with no distracting stupid RGB's .  All those with display knit-picking being 45% ntsc . It doesn't bother at all , you simply can't make out any difference unless keenly compared side by side with a better display and that too with a very sharp eye which most of us won't do .  Keyboard is designed for daily use and not gaming . Good gamers use mechanical keyboard .  For 60k you get a hard drive : add 6k more and upgrade to 500GB ssd . with money still left to upgrade ram to 16 GB, or go for Asus tuf for 75k with similar specs ,makes no sense. 1650 and 1650ti 10% performance boost that is not noticeable in gaming .  Compared to Asus Tuf A15 . Build quality is more premium with compactness and weight distribution. Thermals : With normal use fan noise is absent and heat on body is negligible. Crank it hard it will be hot , worried about it then get a PC assembled with custom cooling. For normal gaming and daily use it is bang for the price.  Battery life : Good , lasted minimum 5 hours .  For programming , CUDA programming it is the best I found in this price bracket. For gaming it will perform with decent score and playable fps.  Cons : I found were lack of USB ports . need to buy a USB c hub . Touch and feel of the laptop gives a premium feel but it is oil and fingerprint magnet , requires frequent cleaning."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"This is a feature loaded laptop for under 60k ( prime day sale). Though AMD reyzen 5 is considered better than i5 but most games ask for amd reyzen 7 or intel i5. So the choice is yours. I hv been playing some games and high graphic games have a difficult time loading up and gets stuck in between.  This model has no ssd, you cannot expect a very fast turning on time or game loading time. Buy the ssd model if u want that superfast speed that you are looking for. I have really felt the need for an SSD in this model.  Other display Graphics and camera are good. Now that the price is around 65k. You can also go for other lenovo models which offer ssd and good gaming performance for the same price."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"A good package for the price. The laptop feels sturdy. Tbe display is good, but could be a bit more clearer. Cooling feels ok. I replaced the 5400RPM drive with an NVME SSD for better performance. The SATA drive makes the system very slow."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I got the product on 8th August. Writing this after 1 week.  Covering the following points:  1. Build Quality -- It's better than expected for the price range. -- Stylish look. -- Solid Build. -- Key travel is good, also key size is better than most laptops. -- Screen lid wobbles a little bit, but not a deal-breaker. -- Trackpad could have been a little bigger.  2. Display -- Could not be more better for this price range. -- Bright enough for me. -- Viewing angles are really good. -- Colors are okayish, cant't complain.  3. Performance(Casual gamer) -- Ryzen 4600H is a total beast. I did run some benchmark tests, it is easily comparable to intel i7/i9 processors. -- Gtx 1650 gives 50-60 FPS over most of the games. -- Booting up takes time and the same for opening apps and games. I think adding a nvme m.2 is a must for this laptop. -- Speaker sound is okay as they are front-firing.  Cons: -- Only 2 USB type-A ports. -- Slow HDD(Solved by adding SSD)  Overall I prefer this over Asus tuf Aa15 because of build quality. It looks much professional and solid."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Laptop has been phenomenal in gaming . Haven't had any problems yet .thermals are fine .I hadn't seen any thermal throttling issues but the idling temperature is kind of sketchy .display is fine ,they could have added a 144 Hz, but it's ok at this price with all this specs. The tracking pad could have a better placement as it intervens some times while gaming and left clicking is not that ok . Battery life is average . Had to update to get the omen command centre working and going and quality wise built quality is also ok but i have a little creeking sound from the hinge and the edges are sharp so can get uncomfortable while using . By the way looks are good and keyboard has good travel is working fine. the ports are ok could've added one more usb port . Overall a good product.*if I have any issues I'll update"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Pros: 1. Great cpu & gpu, future proof. Video exporting takes very little time. Great performance so far. 2. Good ram management. 3. Good built quality, but fingerprint and oil magnet. 4. Good air circulation, providing great cooling. Fan is rarely audible. Can take higher loads than similar asus tuf or msi or lenovo models due to this great heat management. 5. Photoshop and lightroom runs smooth. Filmora is super fast.  Cons: 1. The toshiba hard drive provided is terribly slow. It is an absolute rubbish in this otherwise great laptop. It does too much injustice to the cpu and gpu. YOU MUST UPGRADE TO NVME SSD to actually get the speed. Normal applications take 20-30 seconds to open. Boot time is 30 seconds. Write speed read speed every single thing is bad in this hard drive. My 10 year old laptop had a much better hard drive I must say. It is not at par with 5400 rpm drives. It is slower. It could have been better. Though I have upgraded to 500GB SSD and now the boot time is 12 seconds. Softwares load quite quickly. 2. Only two USB ports. One of them is usb 2.0. Very disappointing configuration. 3. Display is okay for gaming. But for photo and video editing, this is non accurate in color production. Though you can set colors manually from the amd settings lite app. Set the color temperature to about 8000K and saturation to 120%. You will get somewhat better color performance. But still, if you want to be 100% accurate you have to get an external monitor with better RGB percentage or NTSC color gamut. 4. Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve seems to have some problem with Ryzen processors. Both of them are running slow while editing but rendering and exporting is fast. Davinci Resolve quits itself sometimes without saving the project. Premiere pro sometimes takes an age to load a project. I guess this is the issue with RAM. Premiere pro needs a high amount of memory to run. So you might get better performance if you add a second RAM stick of same size and frequency.  Some Tips: 1. Buy 500GB SSD. Those are faster than 240GB versions of same model. Format the ssd before migrating the OS to it. Also be informed that you will need an m2 screw to mount the ssd, which is not supplied in either of the laptop or the ssd package. 2. If disk cloning does not let you boot from the ssd, make a recovery usb drive from your laptop, disconnect the hard drive and install windows from the recovery drive to the ssd. After the setup is complete, connect the hard drive again and format the C drive and the recovery partition in the hdd. 3. While upgrading RAM, always buy a new stick of same size (8 GB) and same frequency (3200 MHz DDR4) with the installed ram. 4. Update windows regularly.  ***All the softwares were tried from their respective trial versions.***"

The laptop fan is fantastic 👌 it doesn't make any type of noise. I have done stress test in this laptop by using aida64. During stress test temperature rises up to 94degrees but the fans are very good they instantly drops the temperature from 94 to 88.  I have used asus tufa15 but it have thermal issue in that laptop temperature reached up to 98 during stress test and while playing pubg mobile on gameloop emulator temperature reached up to 101degrees, finally I have returned asus tufa15 , thanks to Amazon.  Now let's talk about this laptop Pros- Good thermal design. Premium built quality. Slim and stylish charger(150watt)  Hard drive is very fast(there is no ssd but hard drive will make your work done)  Perfect track pad  Sturdy keyboard (having no flex in keyboard)  6hrs of battery (I have used this laptop for 6hrs without charging)  4hrs while gamming (but don't game on it without contacting charger)  White colour backlit keyboard (provides premium feal)  Cons- Booting speed is slow due to hard drive but light application like chrome will open instantly)  No rgb keyboard (but I have no problem)"

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I was a bit anxious before buying the laptop as I wasn't sure if the product I would get would be legit or not or if the laptop got damaged in shipping.  All my doubts were for nothing. The laptop got delivered the very next day in perfect packaging.  The specifications of the laptop are exactly as specified. You can easily get around 50-60 god while palying modern AAA titles. Always make sure that when gaming, the laptop is plugged in, as there is a significant difference in performance between on-charge ad plugged in gaming.  The biggest pro of this laptop is that it NEVER gets hot, even whon the load is extensive, due to the amazing ventilation system. This helps keep the performance at its maximum.  If you are confused between Asus and HP, go for HP. Asus has a terrible ventilation system whic in-turn affects it's performance. Pro-tip-: Disable start-up processes and uninstall pre-installed windows software that is not required. This will make you laptop faster. Also, enable ultimate performance using powershell. You can look up how to do that on YouTube."

Don't use this without an SSD, I repeat, DO NOT use this without an SSD, it is 10 times faster with an SSD. 2. The web cam is pretty bad and the microphone isn't great either. 3. You'll get an average battery life of 3 to 4 hours with light usage(youtube, video conferencing, Spotify, Netflix, etc). However, it drains in about 1 hour while gaming. But on the plus side, it only takes about 3 hours to charge fully. You can improve the battery life by following some simple youtube videos. 4. It runs games pretty well. It ran cs go and modern combat 5 without any problems at all. It also ran apex legends fine, no lag but sometimes the frame rate dips and it gets a little choppy even on best performance mode. The cooling is done well, no heating problems and you can barely hear the fans. 5. The graphics card is amazing and the display is very high definition. The processor is fast and runs everyday tasks very smoothly. 6. I really like the speakers on this. They are loud and clear, good speakers from Bang and Olufsen. 7. It's quite a thin and light laptop, considering its gaming laptop. I really love the design on this, it's got a smooth black finish and it's really stylish, really refreshing coming from the boring generic laptop design.  So overall, a fast and worth-the-money laptop, provided you use an SSD, and you should."

The only con is it only runs with HDD, but ssd can be added easily. For the gamers, GTA5 runs smooth on high settings, COD Warfzone on low settings, but they're running smoothly. Go for it, if it's available :D"

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Best laptop in 60k
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Design --Looks good in hands but edges are bit sharp you can shave with with if you want. Weight--2KG is normal for a gaming laptop Performance--Nothing to complain AMD 4600H can manage whatever you throw. Temp--- No heat at all max temp it reached while playing Deus ex mankind divided at High was arround 70c.Very good thermal management.  Display--- it has 45 NTSC color but good for watching movies/Gaming ,blacks are very deep. Display is 6 bit at 60Hz. Speaker average nothing to complain. Wifi6 AX, Bluetooth 5.0  Problems which i faced Don't install Radeon driver from AMD site it will cause very slow reboot time it will took about 5min even in SSD.  install drivers only from HP. You can download/install Nvidia driver from Nvidia site no promblem in it.  try to buy m.2 screw while you purchasing NVME ssd because no screw for ssd slot in laptop."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Speed feel very slow compare to SSD. We miss keyboard purple backlight. Keyboard back light is white. As per specifications we can add SSD in m.2 slot and same can increase Ram 8gb. But I have not sure because I have not opened laptop back cover for add SSD and ram. not yet check for gaming because we purchase for online classes and office work.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Future proof laptop with 6 cores and high speed. Options to upgrade both RAM and SSD. Good sound and mic quality. Good speed. Sturdy and looks are minimalist which works well for office goers.  Lowest price of 61k for the 4600H models available in the market.  Good battery life of around 5+ hrs, brightness is good. Brightness is fine in indoors and haven't tried outdoors and don't have such a kind of need.  Felt it bit heavy. But my usage is within home and doesn't need to move it around much."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"So this is my first gaming laptop purchase, and I wanted to be sure about picking a laptop with good CPU, GPU and thermal performance. After spending a fortnight looking for the right ones, I settled for this.  Here are the Standout features: 1. CPU- Ryzen 4600h hexacore blows away the competition, i5 10th gen and i7 9th gen quad core CPUs have no chance in front of this one. 2. GPU- Nvidia 1650 with 4gb RAM is sufficient for the price, 60+ FPS on Most AAA titles, make sure to switch off Battery saving mode in nvidia experience centre to get the best performance 3. Thermal performance is absolutely amazing, HP's OMEN series would feel shy of its performance against this one 4. Battery backup and charger provided are pretty good, 150watt fast charger for this price is an awesome addition  Things that are okayish: 1. Screen: the panel and picture quality is good, but brightness could have been a bit better. 60hz at this price point is more than enough, AAA titles won't run beyond 70-80hz on this config 2. RAM: Though it's 3200mhz RAM, but it's from samsung so performance is nothing to write home about. Good thing, we can add another 8gb stick to bump up the performance 3. HDD: Description on Amazon says it's 7200rpm, but it's 5400rpm and just like all HDDs it's slow AF. Crystalmark read scores range between 80-130mbps at best. But I have added a Kingston a2000 500gb m.2 Nvme SSD, which easily gives 2000mbps+ read speed. Boot time went from over 1 min to under 10 seconds. Pro tip- don't clone windows to SSD, do a fresh install, Warranty stays intact. Disable all unnecessary items during startup using task manager. 4. Keyboard Backlight: Nitpicking, but I would have preferred RGB. White backlight looks cool though.  Overall it's an amazing pick, HP has done a commendable job with this one and it's an easy pick over similar offerings by ACER and ASUS. Go for this if your budget is 60-70k, add a 500gb SSD and 8GB RAM to get the best out of this beast."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"After 2 weeks of usage. -I don't know what to say but the HDD is in this laptop So terribly Slow. -Boot time 2min+ always. -It can run any AAA games but due to HDD usage 100% you might be feel Shuttering issues even on low settings. I tried Some games like (witcher 3 on high settings 50 fps constant which is pretty good) and (csgo on low settings and got 200+ fps) but when i tried Farcry 5 there is some issue even on low settings, the shutterings are there because of HDD usage 100% while these type of games. -apart from gaming i tried some editing and rendering work, i would say this processor is so powerful.  Conclusion - UPGRADE TO SSD AND RAM"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"CPU power is awesome. GTX 1650 is enough to run most AAA titles at 60 fps in medium settings. I play games casually.  Other such laptops which fall under the same league would include ASUS TUF A17, A15, Lenovo ideapad gaming ryzen version. I do not recommend ASUS TUF due to poor display and thermals.  I see many reviews mentioning that there is no SSD. But buying your own and adding it is much cheaper than when it comes preloaded. Same goes for RAM too.  I invested an extra 6.5k to add 250gb SSD and 8gb RAM. I bought it for 57k. So for 63k, I don't see any other laptop with the same specs."

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"1. Processor - 4600H with 6 cores, 12 threads, 7nm lithograpgy. Its fast enough to beat i7- 10 gen 14nm processors 2. Display - its 60hz with good viewing angles, 250 nits brightness. 144hhz not there. 3. RAM -8GB ddr4 3200 mhz. upgradable to 16GB. 4. Build. Plastic polycarbonate light body. No metallic build. Justifiable in this 60K price point. 5. Keyboard. White light backlit keyboard. 6. Speaker- I found them much better than other brand laptops. BO audio is good enough. 7 Battery- 5-6 hours on normal surfing. 52 W hrs with 150W charger. 8. Touch pad- multi-gesture pointing device. 9 HDD- very sluggish, better move to Nvme PCI SSD. 10. Graphics-Nvidia 1650 for gaming.(I am not a gamer). 11. Single panel accesses to upgrade RAM and SSD. 12. Poor webcam. 13. No fingerprint sensor and face login not supported on this model."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Its almost a year since I am using this laptop. The build quality of this laptop is very poor. After 1 year of use, white spots started appearing on the display. Overall design is also poor. The sharp edges on the laptop makes it quite uncomfortable to use it on a lap. Even on a desk the wristpad is not at all comfortable to use.  With respect to specs, it is very good. 4600h has great performance. The laptop is easily upgradeable. I added a ssd which improves its performance a lot.. boot time reduced from 10 mins to 10 secs!  If you mostly use laptop connected to an external monitor and keyboard mouse setup, then its okay. Otherwise look for something which is more ergonomic and comfortable."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Overall an excellent machine. The reason for giving 4 stars is there is a little bit of squeaking noise while opening the lid making you feel like the build quality is not top notch. Its a powerful gaming machine and played almost all hevy games at high resolution with no lags whatsoever. Go for it guys, best deal considering the price point. Well recommended...have fun!"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Update: i run it without ssd and it runs horribly slow and freezes sometimes. [I got this for 58k] Lets get straight into it: 1)PROCESSOR- its very good since it has ryzen 4600h, i am able to play gta 5 on high settings very smoothly with good frame rates( i think it can work on ultimate settings too but i didn't felt the need of it), i even play other games like Hitman and Unreal tournament on Ultimate settings with no lag as of yet. 2) BATTERY- is somewhere i feel it could have been better. I've only used it while playing games till now (ill be updating) and it drains fast, i usually have to plug charger. 3) DISPLAY- for me its fantastic. The brightness is apt for indoor usage( you'll face problem outdoors). It has anti glare which is essential for my eyes. 4) CAMERA/SPEAKERS/TOUCHPAD- Camera is the worst you cam say, you'll have to compromise with the pixels..its qyite grainy..i mean its not that bad but you get my point. Speakers are upto the mark infact, really good at this price range.it has B&o speakers just above the keypad (which adds to looks too) and its very audible with sufficient bass (not for bassheads but hey its a laptop). Touchap, for me is very nice it has got this matt finish which feels good. NOW SOME NEGATIVES: FIRST THING, BUY A SSD. Secondly i am experiencing lags after windows updates in just 2 weeks. But its a windows glitch i hope i can fix it. Battery as i said could have been better. Also camera isn't that good. The material its build of, some plastic i guess although looks Premium but when it catches fingerprint very fast, you'll need to clean it to keep it new. BEST THING: IS THAT this provides ryzen 4600h and games are running very smoothly. It does its job. The NVIDIA gtx 1650 adds to it. **You can buy this 1 tb variant and add a 512gb ssd yourself and it'll cost you less and better than many other laptops of the same price range. One more thing its Light weight and portable. I'll be updating it later."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"First of all this is too slow like it takes so many time to open normal browser. The packaging of product by seller is worst, when I'm going to receive my order it's box was opened. Well in future I'm going to upgrade it with 500 gb ssd. Pros- AMD Ryzen 4600 this is amazing with Nvidia GTX 1650 Well cooling system is too good. It comes with black Mate finish which is really good. Battery backup is also pretty good.  Cons- It's too slow like whenever I tried to open Photoshop it takes around 1 to 2 minutes. I don't know why but really guys it's too slow."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"So I bought the device on 6th Aug 2020 on PRIME DAY for 57k and added a 256gig nvme drive for 3.3k. After waiting for 2yrs to get a zen 2 based device I finally got one. I have a R5 1600/GTX 1070 PC already so bought this for coding and running gpu intensive tasks like training a ML algorithm while on the go to various events or when colleges start back up...  PROS: 1. 6C/12T 4600h is a 7nm 45W beast, even when compared to the 3750h you basically get the perf of a i5 u series processor as bonus. For sustained loads performs better than even the 8C16T 4700u, although the 4800h will sure up the perf even more... 4600h perf is very good for the price 2. Intel AX200 WiFi 6 compared to WiFi 5 on older sku still selling around the same price 1650 GDDR6 is a good middle ground gpu, runs games like JC4 at 45fps high, Gta V 70fps Med-high, Doom 2016 90-110fps, Flight Sim 2020 Struggles at 20fps med but that's another story 🤣 3. 3200mhz non soldered 1x8GB 3200mhz cl22 SK Hynix RAM, can be easily upgraded once 3200mhz ram gets more common 4. Boosts to 4ghz on all core even when battery powered 🤯 5. Vega 7 iGPU uses only 512mb of ram compared to 1-2gb on 3550h/3750h 6. 52Whr Battery Lasts 7-8hrs on video playback, 4-5hrs in light office usage, 2hrs when gaming with both cpu and gpu on full load...(although gaming on battery power is not recommended). 7. Compiles Clean Lineage OS build in 63min while my desktop took ~90min. 8. Clean White Backlit Keyboard with 3 Levels of control. 9. Its a HP Pavilion not OMEN, Design is kinda sleeper and won't attract attention. 10. Temps are under control even though it uses a basic 2 heatpipe shared config, because the vents are open unlike the Asus Tuf A15. 11. Supports Freesync Between 40-60Hz  CONS: 1: Software is quite buggy, The Included Omen Command Center doesn't have any perf profiles or fan control, The preincluded RyzenMaster SDK with it was causing BSOD after a bios update which had to do something with HPET being enabled. 2. Linux Distros aren't properly supported as of now, only managed to boot manjaro with igpu and upcoming ubuntu 20.09 on kernel 5.6, pop os, solus, kali etc wouldn't boot but should get fixed with time. WSL2 works fine thou. 3. The Display is only 250nit 6bit panel and is further gimped by the default vari-bright setting, I'd advise to disable it and toggle the color temp setting to off to get a better experience. 4. Ethernet has been dead for me ever since the BSOD due to omen command center. (Yes I've tried reinstalling them) 5. Speakers although forward firing are meh. 6. Lot of Bloatware, The HP Sound Switcher was consuming 20% of cpu randomly for instance. 7. Camera is crap but better than nothing (g14, Mi Notebook). 8. Only 2 USB-A ports 1 of which is 2.0. 9. Corners are sharp and dig into hands.  As most of the cons are software and compatibility I hope it will age like fine wine, and get better...  Although this is great for me, this config stays out of stock most of the time, the 71k config is great as well, You get a 1650ti which is ~5-12% better and may give 5-10 more fps, a 144hz display and a ssd pre included.  All things considered I believe its a much better purchase than any 9300h or 10300h devices in the same price range, and they should seriously differentiate the 4th gen renoir parts, as many people were suggesting the 3750h model which also sells for the same price but is much inferior in cpu department.  Its priced better than the A15 and g14 for a similar perf, not to mention hp's own omen line"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Bought the laptop in Jan. - Add an SSD and the overall user experience will be great. - Battery Backup is great. - The fans will only runs at its max when the temps reaches 94C. - Touch pad for the model I got is loose and will make a rattling noise while using. It's pretty annoying. - 2 USB ports is a disadvantage. Overall pretty happy with the laptop. Go for Legion if you got the extra money.

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I usually don't write reviews unless I find a product exceptionally wonderful, or extremely terrible. This was a mixed product. My initial reaction upon using the laptop was of mild dissappointment. The system was slow, like, really slow. But when I added an ssd card, the performance was wonderful and satisfying. Then came the unfortunate incident. I do not know if this was particular to my product since I do not see anyone else mentioning this in the reviews, but my screen broke internally without absolutely any external force or disturbance. Since screen cracks are not covered under warranty, I found myself in a terrible place. I do not know if my particular product had more fragile panel or what, but it cracked entirely, and there is no crack or scratch on the glass externally. Because the refresh rate is low (60hertz), I could find a replacement panel outside of HP service centre. Hp centre provided no assistance even when I was ready to pay for the replacement. They talked about having to order and ship the panel when I asked if it could be fixed within a couple of weeks.  This was my only issue. Also, without ssd, the lap is pointless. You can't really use it as a gaming lap without ssd. So, whatever cost you are buying this product for, add an extra 5k to it in order to get what you would actually be spending on the laptop. Thanks for reading!"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,This laptop is good. Its actual price is around 60k but I got this from Amazon at 65k. It doesn't come with SSD but there is an extra M.2 slot which is great. Backlit keyboard is nice with 2 level of brightness. Battery is not so great and the adaptor gets very hot during charging. Display is 60fps which is good enough for me as I'm not a gamer but I run VMs and emulators and stuff. I recommend to get an SSD then it makes the full use of 4600H processor. Edit: After a day or two of buying it got a BIOS update and the battery is working fine.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Hi, so this is a review after a month long usage, and the game played was GTA 5. The laptop build quality and its looks are awesome. It's genuinely a beautiful laptop, and comes with Win 10 home pre-installed. I would recommend don't go for set-up service, as it's overcharged, you just have to enter your microsoft email id or gmail id n u r good to go.  The Battery life is decent too, for heavy game usage. It does survive upto and hour n half of heavy gaming. Let me come to the 2 parameters for which I gave lesser cost.  The performance of the laptop from a gaming aspect is strictly average to below average. You have to play GTA 5 with least graphic settings so that the frames per second don't drop, and the game doesn't lag. Else it lags like anything.  Before buying, I had noticed many criticising its lack of ssd and I felt the reviewers are being too harsh. But I realise they are right. The difference the hdd and ssd show are very high, and I plan to set up ssd once my warranty ends. Mind you, ssd will not improve game performance, but it will be a good addition to speed up booting, and other primary tasks.  From a daily task standpoint, I feel the laptop is an 11/10. It's cute, gets tasks done, delivers on its basics. But to have it named as a gaming laptop is just not justifiable. Do get in touch with me on my Instagram if you have more queries."

But later, i discovered that you cant play in Radeon Graphics when the laptop is charging, as the FPS drops to 15 when you do so. So I had to switch to the NVIDIA dedicated graphics. It was much better as I could now play while charging. But the FPS got limited to 61. Expected higher gaming performances. But overall, it's performance is quite satisfactory."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Within the replacement time period i went to edge of its testing...and honestly it did its top notch performance within this price range with such good specs and just a slighy modification i.e. installing a 256gb or 500gb NVME SSD this is totally a beast performer with following specs :- •Ryzen 5 4600h •8GB ddr4 ram with 3200mhz •4GB Nvidia GTX 1650 GDDR6 •1TB HDD •IPS Panel 60FPS NOTE : I WOULD RECOMMEND U TO BUY A SSD OF 500GB TO GET AND EDGE OVER SPEED AND OVER ALL SPACE AND THIS IS TOTALLY BEAST...WITH AROUND 65K❗
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Looks its out of Stock on AMZ,but good product. SSD could have been added. Pros: Almost light Weight. Battery life is great. Full size num pad Cons Build wise,Sharp edges on almost every corner. Keyboard (Up,Down)scroll keys are small sized ,making it difficult to scroll. Could have accommodated additional USB port. Sleep Fn key missing . No Numlock indicator (CAPS lock has indicator). RAM heat sink is just an Black paper , maybe could have upgraded it ."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I purchased this laptop 1 month ago, and it is performing good, the processor is excellent. Ryzen 4600h easily outperforms 9th gen Intel core i5 and even older i7 processor. However the HDD is too slow, it is bottleneck in whole laptop, so you must have to purchase an SSD. I also installed Samsung 970 evo plus 500 gb and 8GB crucial 3200 Mhz Ram, and now it have became beast in terms of performance. Overall a very good laptop, display is excellent, although speakers are little bit less loud but sound quality is good."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"They have Advertised Game +Business in and Microsoft free, so not stand on there words... Regards Laptop is too slow, but they have mentioned in add they are giving me Microsoft Office to but now its demo version... Gaming is too slow... I think go for other model instead of this..."

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Go for it. Just received today. So far its perfect. Will update my review within few weeks.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Good great product under 60 k
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Very slow hdd. Slower than any other laptop, the wd hard disk in this is horrible. Windows boot time is around 1min+. There's surely something wrong with the HDD it comes with. Added a 500gb WD Nvme ssd and installed windows on it ."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,*not an expert just personal experience** amazing laptop for only 66k will definitely suggest AMD instead of intel because of huge price difference but similar performance current games run smoothly picture quality is good for normal use battery is good for gaming 2.5 - 3 hr but since it does not have SSD things take a bit of time sometimes that's the only issue i faced till now
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Performance is not as expected. Totally waste of money.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,All over performance is descent considering the specifications with this worth. Though it takes around a minute to start due to online hdd included. A 256 gb Ssd would be appreciated. No such heating issues. White light Backlite keyboard is attractive. Playing high end games for 2 hours drains the battery. You have to play games only on charging it is recommended. Camera quality is very poor. It is like 360p video quality. Audio is very poor. 4 stars out of 5. Recommended to buy in this price range
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,It is very slow due lack of ssd so recommend you buy a veriant with ssd it is very very slow
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Not so worthy
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"First thing you must do is buy a NVME ssd asap if you're buying this laptop. Because it has the worst HDD which just cant run anything other than movies and games. if you are thinking of installing large softwares then you need to install an ssd .After that ,the laptop just works absolutely fine. HIGHLY recommended"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"A complete package in its budget... Superb Processor, Awesome screen for smooth running of 4k movie,Brilient brightness...Sound is little bit quite but very soothing...Battery life ok...A perfect built quality...A light weight ,slim gaming laptop."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,The startup time is terribly terrible. Avarage is more than 5 min. Feels like living in an age of 90's! Not at all recommended to invest your money. Not sure how the SSD version will perform. But didn't expect the HDD version to be so pathetic.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"The laptop is beast for gaming and VM as well. You can easily run multiple apps. No FPS drop during game. Played CSGO for 5 hours straight and no lag, no problem. Batter life great and speakers are okay. You won’t get a better processor and graphics card in this range. To increase boot speed, go for SSD that is very easy to install."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Without ssd storage is lags like dos computers from 20th century. Videos hang. Scrolling hang. Without even having any major applications on. The screen is very dull. The Colors are faded and it looks bad for such expensive laptop. Videos pixelate. Webcam is pathetic. Again for the price range. Very disappointed!!
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,very good product. Got it for 50k after exchanging a 2011 i3 dell.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Attention please.... Install a nvme hard disk, u will really get to know it's full potential. Heating issue is there due to gaming. No lags in gaming. Overall it's a caged beast"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Not worthy to buy . Not at all . Not fit for gaming.worst product ever bought in my life...

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,The product is bottlenecked due to it's HDD but otherwise everything is to the mark. It takes to much time to boot up but adding a SSD will make it a complete beast
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Don't buy without SSD... Every thing is going on very slow.... HDD is 5400 rpm... Very bad.... Build quality is excellent. Speaker also good. You can buy this laptop but with SSD....
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I got it for ₹57,775 with 8.5K discount on exchange with lenovo-intel-i3 old laptop. Its the best laptop in its price segment. Its CPU is sooo Good that it outshines some Intel's i7 processors. It gives double performance than what intel offers in this price."

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Worth for price Performance is good But you had to add ssd Heat dissipation is proper that the heat is reduced within minutes after closing the game or any heavy task
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,I would recommend to add ssd The booting time is too slow 1 to 2 mins to start And over all good you can use any of the heavy softwares
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Great laptop at this price,having best spec Also built quality is great especially keyboard,mouse little buffers But overall great laptop"

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"If you get it at 60k then buy it without thinking and add a ssd in future if hdd is slow for you, for me hdd is quite good. If you want a full review of it then search deeptesh loves tech and watch his videos on this laptop. Good luck."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Cons 1. Too costly 2. Poor performance 3. Camera is too bad 4. System is running very slow after a without any apps in it. Imagine after installing 5-10 apps. 5. Overall not recommended.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"For gaming it is good, battery life is good and camera quality is shit even my jio phone has a better camera, just kidding it's better than jio phone but this is a performance king and the best thing in this laptop is no overheating, loved it."

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Overall experience with the laptop is great but the HDD is a little bit slow comparing with the powerful Ryzen processor.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Just add a ssd to it and it will will in its best proformance or else if u not do so it will lag sometimes becoz the hard disk cant take the load of this powerfull procwssor

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Good
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I got the base variant @60k. The internal 1TB is terribly slow. I highly suggest to get an SSD. My experience so far is good with some issues. Note: I gave 2 stars because of faulty speaker in my unit. As soon as the issue is resolved I'll give it 5 star rating since it really deserves it. The left speaker seems faulty, I doubt this is the case with all units. A technical specialist from amazon is supposed to visit and if found faulty I'll get a replacement. let's see how it goes. The laptop is good with good performance. I am not a gamer till now I've only tried Forza Horizon and it runs at ultra setting at 60+ fps. Pros: 1. The display is just gorgeous!! I read in the specification this display has 1700:1 contrast ratio and that makes is so enjoyable to watch content. It also has very good viewing angles. The colours seems absolutely fine to me. 2. The sleek design makes it stand out. This doesnt look ""gamery"" at all! Look really cool with all those sharp edges. 3. The exhaust vents are at the back of the laptop so you won't have to deal with hot air. The fans don't get loud. At full load fans are audible but not ""noisy"". 4. The keyboard is fine. The keys are soft and a bit musy. But also don't need much actuation force so you can type faster. I have never tried mechanical keyboard so this keyboard seems just fine. 5. The mics are really good. It does a good work at cancelling background noise. Cons: 1. This this is a fingerprint magnet. No i mean seriously just a touch and it'll still pick up fingerprints like crazy. Only after a while of usage the Laptop will look dirty. Keep a cotton cloth nearby to clean it regularly lol. 2. ONLY 2 USB ports. ONLY ONE of them is 3.0 the other is 2.0. This is an issue especially while using external HDD or pendrive since i use a mouse and keyboard connected to the laptop. 3. No manual fan control. Everything is automatic. Altho the fans rarely kick in But more control over fans would be a plus point. 4. No charge threshold for battery charge. Unlike some other brands like lenovo where you can set a charge threshold limit (say 80%) to limit charge and prolonging the battery life. I mostly use this laptop plugged in so having such an option to limit charge would be really great. 5. The speakers are...not that loud. But the quality is really good. Enough to fill a small room. 6. The inbuilt 5400rpm is terrible. REALLY slow. get a ssd rea9lly! 7. You get about 4.5 - 5.5 GB free ram after bootup. (Kinda okayish) 8. The bottom bezel is waaaay too big and noticable. Certainly no ""immersive"". 9. The camera is terrible. Too much noise in room lighting. 10. The right side of the keyboard deck gets warm(not uncomfortable but just warm)  Over all I'm satisfied with the product. I'm just hoping for my replacement unit since my unit has defective speakers. I have faith in amazon to help me in this situation, Let's hope for best. Update: I decided to go with a different brand now. Not really HP's fault but these small issues are getting annoying to deal with. If you don't face any issues then this laptop is truly amazing value for money!"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,At the time of presenting this laptop it was only 60k now it's 65k.. Why are you guys increasing the product price. The product actual price is only 60k and it only has the value of that money
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Writing a review after 1.5 months, purchased the laptop from HP Store  CPU: 6 hyperthreaded cores, (12 total) at 3ghz is pretty great, I can compile google chrome with discord and VLC running, without any lag at all. It's not the fastest CPU but for a 60k laptop I'd say it's really good, AMD is great. It does get somewhat hot, though (4/5)  RAM: It depends on what work you're doing, I've upgraded mine to 16GB and it has never lagged so far, even while video editing/rendering. Apart from that, 8gb is just enough for most people.  WiFi/Bluetooth: supports 5G WiFi and has a really good range, this is the only device I have that can even play YouTube videos in the WiFi's blind spot. Though I usually use ethernet. Bluetooth is.. fine, enough for my bluetooth headphones, what else do you need? (5/5)  Display: the 144hz display is really snappy when playing osu!, though for some reason I experience screen tearing while watching videos sometimes. I will say that the colors are somewhat off, especially purple/blue. Apart from that it's a good display. (3.5/5)  GPU: I can't say much about the GPU, It runs osu! at 220FPS which is really great, but I rarely play games, sadly  Keyboard: The backlight is really good, great for asthetic and also typing in the dark. Highly recommended, though it's stuck on purple, I have -1 problems with that but I just warned you. The keys are great, they make a nice sound, but aren't clicky (what else do you expect from a laptop keyboard). But the layout, it's a big -100/5, I can go for years ranting about the keyboard layout, it hurts my fingers, it's really easy to touch the trackpad because of the space key being too close to it, who uses a numpad on a gaming laptop! Seriously, get a good keyboard (2/5)  Speakers: Impressive, I never expected a laptop to have this good speakers, it blew me away (3.5/5)  Trackpad: Very easy to get used to and the default gestures are nice. But I'll stick to a mouse, seriously, don't waste your hands' life (4/5)  Battery: At moderate usage it lasts around 3 hours with the GPU running (I use only the Nvidia card, by default it switches between Nvidia and integrated graphics dynamically switching, which uses less battery) and with nodejs, two web browsers, and discord running constantly  Misc: - The body/keyboard is a fingerprint magnet, even though it's just plastic - The bezel actually looks really nice, and the corners of the body aren't rounded which gives the premium feel. I think small bezels look extremely ugly, this looks really cool - The right side of the body can get somewhat hot but it's not that bad unless you are doing extremely heavy stuff (like compiling a game or something) - It comes with pre-installed software which is kinda bad IMO, to get your space back, just install Windows 10 again  Linux Support: Dual booting with Windows 10 and Arch Linux wasn't that great, I wanted to use Legacy Boot but I can't find an option in the BIOS; though GPT is fine.. just reminding that you shouldn't waste your time and just use GPT, or let your OS handle it. Apart from that, setting up the drivers was very easy, I'm using the proprietary drivers never tried nouveau. This GPU works great with Linux since the proprietary drivers are available on Arch's repository, unless some of the other ones. Apart from that, never really had any problems; if you are using something like Manjaro or Ubuntu then you won't even have these 2 problems, hopefully."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I am Reviewing this product after 2 months.I would suggest you to upgrade the storage to nvme ssd to wake the beast . Boot up time is high and varying,battery run time 3-4.5 hrs approx without gaming. No heating issues. As it has matt finish ,requires constant cleaning to avoid contact prints .Once scratched it stays permanent , however we can cover it up with laptop design skinks. And yeh the track pad makes a sound at the right corner. The best keyboard. MS office subscription is unavailable. Mc.Afee antivirus shields for 1 month. Quiet performance nd thr is no hard disc sound. Web cam is good and the best thing is light indication for web cam ,so u need not search for the icon. Extraordinary speakers by B&O. laptop case is mandatory for protection, pls don't use silicon keyboard covers or screen guards. They are good as they are. True IPS display, Vivid image clarity. Would have been great with another usb 3.0 port but not an essential requirement for me. GtX1650 to the mark. On box indication says that we cannot claim warranty outside india. yep,built in china but they dont own the brand. Screen has very thin bezel . Has network boosting feature(omen command center) along with switching option for graphic card between Nvidia and radeon vega(integrated). Yeh i bought this cos it is future proof and a reliable brand, was available at an average cost ,AMD 4000 series has outmanoeuvered i5-9th,i5-10th,i7 9th intel generations. But not till ssd installation."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Got this for 59k and this laptop is totally worth it. Pro's:- i. Comes with ryzen 4600 H processor so being a 6 core 12 threads processor it works really good, better than i5 10th Gen and also gives a tough competition to i7 10th Gen. ii.Booting time is around 30-40 seconds and is really good as it only comes with HDD and no SSD. iii. Has a really good cooling system and that laptop never gets overheated. iv. HP provides you with 1 month free trial of McAfee antivirus. v.Nice build quality . vi. Also best for gaming. vii. Battery last for around 4-5 hours on average usage like watching some videos and doing light work. vii. Good audio quality Con's:- i. The HDD provided with the laptop is a bit slow so I recommend you to add a SSD if you need to boot up the device really fast."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I've been using this laptop for more than a month now.. I primarily use it for video editing and gaming..  Design is good, it grows on you.  Keyboard is good with 2 levels of backlight.  Battery life is not great and you can't expect great battery life out of a gaming PC so it's normal.  Cam quality is average  The performance as is is just okay.. Not because of CPU or GPU limitation because Ryzen 5 and GTX1650 is a powerful combo.. It's because of HDD. You really need an SSD upgrade because HDD just doesn't cut it, when I do video editing it comes down to a crawl.. Also you only get 6Gb of usable RAM because 2 is reserved by Vega Graphics..  My recommendation: Buy this laptop because price is good.. As soon as possible, put in an SSD an RAM and you'll have a beast of a laptop.. If on budget, atleast upgrade SSD. Oh btw this unit did not come with the Omen Gaming software.. So no manual fan control and stuff.. I did find it in the Microsoft store but haven't installed it yet..  Overall as a package 5 stars from me because at this price it's very accessible and it's an excellent base. With the upgrade potential it'll be just as good as the higher end variants of this laptop."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Low end ryzen processor with 1650 at this budget is worst. At least get 1660ti if you're getting ryzen processor
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Nice laptop but its price rise is sad, it was of 60k in August prime sale then 61k after sale and now 66k+, more than 6000rs price rise in a month. Still a nice gaming laptop but not value for money anymore."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Ok I'm just gonna put it straight, if you don't buy this you would be stupid because it's got ryzen 5 hexa core processor so take the intel and dump it in the garbage both 8th, 9th and 10th gen gaming laptops under 60000. Because ryzen 4000 series is a performance monster and they run cooler and they are power efficient. It's take intel and crush this processor can compete with intel i7 so yeah its good deal way better than overpriced intel junk. 11th gen intel is good but it's not here yet so rn this is the best."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,I've been eyeing this laptop to buy since long time but the seller has increased the price from 60k to 65k. At the time of presenting it was only 60k how can they increase the price.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"I have used dell, hp, sony vaio in the past.. hut lenovo is perfect amongst them. No heating issue even after hours of working.. no sound too. Its amazingly fast and you will not regret once you own it."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,overheat and cheap quality
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"i am writing from this laptops only, i shall list out the pros and cons:- pros:- *ryzen 5 4600h- this is a very powerful processor, i got 3332 points in cinebench r20, for comparison, my friend had i7-1065G7, and his points were 1546, now u can decide. *gpu- gtx 1650 is decent, can play older AAA titles well, but new ones it will be difficult. *webcam- i would say it as average, not too good or not too bad *build quality-- this also average, since plastic is used, occasionally u can hear some squeaks, but considering the price range , it is ok * speakers-- very good cons--- * the main disadvantage is hdd, man it is so slow, it bottlenecks ur performance, ssd is compulsory after u buy it. its like replacing the tyres of a lamborghini with nanos tyres. the hdd sucks * only 2 usb ports if possible, get asus tuf a15 base model, because that gives you better value, but this is also a good option"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"The specs this laptop offers is easy for running any of the latest AAA open world, massive multiplayer game lobbies with a steady smooth fps on relatively satisfactory visual quality. But the price could be a bit lower. I suggest you check out Lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 15ARHO5 on Lenovo's official website. Right now there's 20% discount and you can customize the laptop. With the same specs as above I swapped the 512gb with 256gb SSD and added 1tb SATA HDD 5400rpm And selected 120hz rr and with everything else being the same specs as above. And with all that the IdeaPad came around 58000. So I suggest you check out this once before you buy pavillion."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"its my first day with the laptop and i found 2 major defects - 1. boot time is really very slow . Takes 5 to 10 min to start , didn't expected with a 8gb RAM laptop sol- add SSD  2. display color defect .  grphics- decent batterylife is ok , but i would recommended to use charger everytime  if u want to buy the same pavalian series I would recommend u to buy 54,000 Rs variant"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"I got laptop with decent packing,extreme fast delivery got it in two days. Pros-Decent and premium look,lightweight,ready fir professional use. -Good built quality but screen shakes for a second after opening. -Processor and graphics are great. -30 days trial antivirus. -You can extend warranty also. -Battery charges fastly and gives decent backup upto 5-6 hours on normal use. Cones-At first time it takes 4-5 minutes to start,then it boots in 30 sec but requires 1-1:30 min for use. -During setup it restarted automatically,again took 4-5min to start. -After proper start,application opens 3-4 sec,not that much slow as expected due to hdd . -Total setup take 20-30 min be patient. -Ssd upgrade is required if you are gamer. Overall laptop is good value for money at 60k dont buy at 66k you can buy lenovo ideapad gaming 3 at 67k with pre-installed ms office and ssd. I am engineering student so i will fo some 3d modelling and then update my review.But this is good laptop."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"So First of all thanks to @gamingsetupdeals.Search in telegram Gaming Setup deals and offers and just join this channel for best offers on laptops . Now coming to the review,this laptop comes around 50000 and Hp is just offering quite a good specs.I had just taken this laptop for classes and stuff and for very casual gaming(like once in a week) Just ran some GTA V, Plague Tale and Far Cry games and this laptop is just fine and gives FPS of around 40 FPS in ultra setting and an easily 60+ FPS at medium settings and for classes this laptop goes at a very fluent way and never hangs between the classes....never faced any heating issues yet. So I think around 50k it's the best choice."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,It's overpriced for 65k It will only cost around 60k . And also it comes without ssd. This is the only drawback.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,"Has of now it is good it's taking time to boot when we start the laptop, other than its ok"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1024AX,laptop,Worst laptop performance ever. After a year of usage it gives u soo embarrassing movements ever. It doesn’t works as it seems to. It stucks so much not worth buying.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"It seems I am first buyer of this laptop. I ordered laptop on 14th July 2020 and received on 16th July 2020 at Nellore (my relative address) due to lockdown in my home town. So I didnt get a chance to check my laptop immediately. That is my bad luck. After 23rd, I checked Laptop which works fine with 8gb ram ,but it has very poor battery backup. After charging 100 percent laptop, it shows 3 hours for remaining battery backup. I am very disappointed for this. I checked with other reviews also. Now I could not get a chance to return this product. For now, I purchased so many things from amazon. This is very bad experience. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS LAPTOP since we are giving more importance to battery."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"Good spec for this price.. but very disappointed about the battery.. gets drained out in just 2 hours.. even after 10 mins usage from full charge, battery falls to 90% .. am thinking about returning the product.."

Need to return immediately"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,Laptop seems good. Simple laptop with all the configurations as mentioned. Lookwise First impression is good. Office and windows are full version. It takes 15-20 seconds to boot up.  Speed is OK for regular office works. Best thing 2 year warranty  Though adapter seems very delicate
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"Got the delayed delivery for the laptop and used it for 2 days and noticed that battery back up is not even 2 hours which company claims to be more than 5 hours. Extremely low performance on battery front.  Further when you purchase laptop with I5 processor, 8 GB ram and 1 TB HDD ans 256 SSD you can expect good quality camera in laptop which is not the case in this laptop.. camera is extreamly poor quality."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,Excellent performance .im writing this review after 1 week of usage .one of the best laptop under 50k.first am also facing battery backup problem after updates i don't face any battery isssue. u have to wait until software got update.

Smooth and swift functioning. Guide and support for installation. Preinstalled Ms office 2019 home. 1 month antivirus. Battery approx 6 hrs. Auto rebooting on lid opening. Webcamera is good. Sound is normal. Overall a very good buy. The product value the money and overwhelmingly staisfying.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"Not even a month since I bought this...on one fine day I received notification that hardisk malfunctioned. it was taken to Lenovo service center a month back, I haven't received it yet. I was informed by service centre that the hardisk needs replacement. Officials from Lenovo service centre are not at all bothering to service (they took incharge for hardisk replacement), and the reason is, it was bought from online store. I lost my 38k rupees. Though I have warranty, I have to spend my money for the replacing hardisk as there is no response from Lenovo service center...they are least bothered. I am an Amazon customer for the past 6 years and is this the way I am paid back?? I am disgusted. Amazon is unreliable for expensive products. The same happened with a phone I bought a few years back. I'm in need of laptop for my child's online class and the only reason I bought from Amazon is because of covid pandemic. There is a great demand for laptops in store. Amazon has cost me so much money. I am literally fed up."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,First impressions: Speedy Good built Gets the job done smoothly  Things which could have been better- Battery - Doesn't last more that 4hrs Display color - Too bright but the colors are dull Camera- low quality  Please note this model does have lifetime MS Office Home and Student subscription. We just need to go in the app and activate the same.  Will update the review after using for a few months.  So far happy with the product for online teaching and planning purposes.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,Summary after use - Camera quality - This is real bad and am sure you would regret if You would use this laptop mostly for video calling or conferences. It is not a HD camera. Maximum quality is 0.3MP. You would get 10MP front camera in a basic phone these days. My suggestion is for a 50k laptop this was not expected. Suggest you not to buy this My Recommendatiom for list of things to check before you buy ( This is important trust me)- 1) i5 processor 10 th gen 2) SSD hard drive 3) 15.6 inch minimum display size 4) HD camera with minimum 2-5 MP 5) Graphic card if required
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"Performance is really good. It is not proper anti-glare but screen quantity is really good. Design, weight, look and feel is really amazing. I just have an issue with battery backup, on normal use batter backupy is last long to 6-7 hrs but when you use it for video calls or Zoom/Meet/Teams session battery drains in 3-3:15 Hrs.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"I bought this laptop 2 months ago and the below comments came from my real work experience.  Pros: 1. Rebooting very fast. 2. Even supporting for programmer to do multitasking at fast. 3. Average battery. When handling proper charging then we can avoid the heat... 4. Came up with free windows 10 and pre installed MS Office 2019 ( not a 30 days trails). 5. Easy way to setup 1st time. 6. SSD makes fast process. 7. Default video player is really cool. So many options given, like 360' view and editing, taking snapshot  Cons: Camera quality is less, but can sufficient for video call. When Manually run antivirus software ( scan entire files and software l) we can feel over heat... But it become cool immediately after antivirus scan."

Without serial number, neither manufacturer will entertain the warranty claim nor is ready to extend the warranty.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"A value for money product . Bought for Rs49k during sale period. Very fast response time,fast power on , steen clarity awesome, Windows 10 home included , 256GB Ssd gives it speed. Only problem is that it comes with one month free trial version of Microsoft office 365 . Otherwise Best laptop in this price range"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,Following product was ordered based on the specifications mentioned in the description of the product The description provided by amazon is completely misleading and their information on the product is hidden really smartly to fool the customers  Customer Service doesnt respond and even after waiting for 40 minutes there is no resolution and the phone is cut when asked to speak to the supervisor
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"Camera quality is worst (maximum of 0.3 MP). In my opinion, this product is a big waste of money. Amazon has no return policy for such high-value item. If I don't like the product after receiving it, there is no return policy! Next time I 'll go to a store and buy such high value product! Amazon is a big risk."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,I am writing this review after 15 days of usage. very poor battey backup.. U need to plug it all the time with power supply..

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,I had purchased this 2 months back. And I really had a good experience with it. Battery life is awesome. And all in-built features are really great.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"Great specs, very fast boot up. Great value at the price."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,Gives u best of both worlds with 1tb huge storage for files alongwith 256 flash drive for faster booting up.....and 10th gen processor is the latest so u cant get a better value under 50k.... tbh the unit isnt extremely thin & light like macbooks....but still very portable.....so its a good tradeoff
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"After going through so many reviews finally I have purchased this laptop. Believe me you will never regret of selecting this laptop. Battery stands about 4 hours in full use, booting time is 10sec max, genuine Windows and Office......what else required."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,its overall good i buyed this laptop from offline i didnt buy this laptop from amazon but i have the same variant only a slight different is i have mx130 nvidia ge force graphics and its good for gaming like need for speed most wanted and look is stylish and easy to carry
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,Shopkeeper suggested me for engineering and for programming. The processer speed was osm but only fault is with battery it typically lasts only 3hrs and camera quality is avg. If performamce is your choice rather than batterylife than go for it. plz dont buy seriously battery is very bad.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,"It hasn’t even been one year. The laptop is still in warranty but it started showing camera problems. Also, the build is not sturdy enough. And it’s very delicate. If you want your laptop to last for more than 2 years, I would not recommend this product."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,I am sharing my review after 2 month..and product is awasome. But battery life is little bit disappointed other wise great for buying this laptop.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,This laptop is very very slow takes around 30-45 mins to restart. Battery life is max 3hrs. Sometime it gets discharged within 1hr just by being on zoom meeting. Not recommended
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Keyboard-Warranty-82H801CWIN,laptop,Very bad product please no one purchase problem in 1 mounth not hear sound and not sufficient at all

HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,Likes : Performance Dislike: build quality  I have been using Dell laptops since long. This is my first time I bought a HP laptop and I am very disappointed. Went to pavilion series so that I can get better quality than essential series. But worthless.  When I am lifting the laptop in my hands I am hearing annoying sound. Seems like bottom panel near speaker is not well built and set.  Easily banding while lifting. 0 stars for build quality.  Can anyone help me to get refund instead of return. I want to go back to Dell again. Big regret buying this laptop
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"1-look/finish/color awsome 5/5 2-display 4/5 3-battery 4/5 4-speed super 5/5 (multiple tasking easy) 5-graphic card 4/5 (GTA5 tested) 6-price 4/5 (brand value, otherwise 2-3k should be less) 7-big still look compact 8- inbuilt speakers 4/5 9-front camera 4/5 10-office support free lifetime (+point)"
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"The laptop is sleek for its weight. Feels premium. As long as you dont drop or scratch it with any object, the body would stay like new. Finger print scanner is lightning fast. Performance is very good. In battery saver mode you can watch downloaded videos for upto 8 hours. In performance mode the battery drains up too quickly. Everything about the laptop is near perfect, if battery life is not your major point of usage, go for it. The battery life is decent but could have been better. The sound quality is superb. Will update after a couple months of use."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"I bought this laptop because I needed a new computer for photo editing using Capture One Pro. I process a lot of Raw images. I was using my old 5th generation Intel i3 HP Pavilion with 12 GB RAM and 120 GB SSD. I use an external SSD for Raw images because any sort of internal or cloud storage is too limited in capacity. I currently use a Samsung T7 SSD. The problem with the old laptop was, it didn't have a USB C port. So I had to rely on the USB A. To process and save a batch of 200 images it took about 24 hours. So it was time to upgrade.  My options were a Macbook Air with M1 chip with 8GB RAM, or Windows 10 with 16GB RAM. I already have a Wacom One tablet, some external hard disks, all with USB A interface. I needed an SD Card reader. To get all this on a Macbook Air would cost me a small fortune taking my cost to almost 1 lakh rupees taking into account all the possible discounts. A folding laptop with touchscreen would not offer me much cost benefit. This laptop without touchscreen or folding screen, with 2GB NVIDIA card, cost me under Rs. 75,000. Without the NVIDIA, the cost would come down further by another 5,000. I chose the NVIDIA option. The surprise that came after buying the laptop is, the SD card slot is for the micro SD card - the one you use in your mobile phones, not in cameras. That cost me another Rs. 1,200 for a card reader - that's USB A. But not a big problem, because just transferring the images from the SD card to the laptop takes a few minutes, not hours. I can live with that much delay.  Setting up the computer wasn't difficult because I have already set up computers before. We have a family subscription for MS Office. So there was nothing different to set up here. We just had to enter our MS office details.  The computer is fairly light considering that it is a 15"" screen. The battery is internal. So it's slim. We have lighter laptops at home, but that's not something I would complain about when it comes to this computer. Unlike Microsoft Surface 4, the lid doesn't lift up easily to open up. That's another thing I can live with, considering the fact that it's half as cheap. The resolution is 1920x1080. I knew it before I bought it. There are two USB A ports, one USB C port, HDMI, micro SD card reader, a headphone jack.  Ergonomics: I touch type. So the placement of keys matters to me. The keys are fairly soft. The pressure is consistent. The orientation of the top row (QWERTY) and bottom (ZXCV) is fairly streamlined with respect to the home row (ASDFG). That holds on the left and the right side as well. I haven't measured my speed, but I could perhaps type at 120 wpm with a fair level of accuracy. There is a separate number pad which is an advantage offered by the wider area. A 14 and a 13 inch screen normally doesn't offer that advantage. Keyboard is backlit at three intensities - off, medium and bright. During the day you are better off turning the backlight off. In a dark room the back letters are easy to read. I wear glasses. My eyesight is weak. But I still find the letters easy to read, whether unlit, or backlit. The touchpad is pretty nice. It is wide. It was a problem with the earlier computer because you cannot avoid touching the touchpad while using the keyboard, and the curser used to go haywire. With this computer, somehow, the cursor remains undisplaced, moving from touchpad to keyboard to touchpad. I used to prefer using a mouse earlier. This is a pleasant experience even without a mouse. The POWER button is placed amongst the Function Keys. That comes as a surprise the first time when you open the computer. I wouldn't cut a star rating for this, though.  Overall I would not cut any rating points. It is a reasonably priced laptop with reasonable specifications. It did not come with any unpleasant surprises. That is what I would expect from a mid range Windows laptop.  The booting time is pretty fast. I didn't clock it, but it's perhaps less than a minute. If you are too picky where the power supply connects, it's the right side. There is no CD / DVD drive. I am sure most of us are used to it by now.  P.S. : The speakers are by Bang & Olufsen. The sound is pretty nice. Normally, with computer speakers, the digital sound tends to be shrill. This is relatively warm for vocal frequencies and even music. It is quite clear and loud. The built in camera is pretty mediocre. But that is the feature I don't use much. I am not sure if I would, if it was high resolution. If MacBook and Surface don't offer higher resolution, I wouldn't blame this model for offering a similar spec. I read a few reader reviews before this went live. Some with 1 star rating, I found hilarious; and other people actually found them helpful. People seem to want this computer to make coffee, bake a cake and even drive your car. Come on people! Be reasonable. Do your research before you make the purchase rather than playing the blame game because you bought the computer while half drunk."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"This is a complete package laptop 💻 for professionals, if you want to work with high end softwares, editing and development.  But build quality can be made better, we need to take extra care, while traveling but I am completely satisfied with the 16GB RAM ( i5 11 gen), 2 gb graphics.  Kepad backlit can be made better. But totally satisfied with overall features."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Assumed being i5 11th Gen with 16 GB RAM and SSD it would be fast, but not as fast as the ones I saw of MI and Asus 10th Gen with just 8 GB RAM.  It's advisable to go for those models which are much lighter and faster with much cheaper price than for this HP."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Pros: 1) This laptop is value for money and have the latest i5 11th gen processor. 2) It is slim sleek and light weight, easy to carry. 3) Has narrow brezzels. 4) Keyboard has backlit. 5) Some people were saying that it has power button on the left of power button which makes them think that laptop may get shutdown while clicking delete but it is totally wrong as if it may get clicked by mistake then laptop won't get shutdown we need to press windows button+power button to shut down. 6) Fingerprint is very fast get log in 1 sec.  Cons: 1) It doesn't have backlit in spacebar. 2) Battery backup isn't that good as it has 41wh battery. 3) laptop doesn't open single handed. 4) camera quality is not that good but it isn't a major issue as all laptop except surface books and macbook have bad camera quality. 5) touchpad is a little rough but again not an issue you will get habitual towards it."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"The actual price is in between 66k to 68k, But here in Amazon or Flipcart they will always increase the price by 1-2 k, I bought it for 68k after adding offers. Product is excellent."
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560424WIN9S,laptop,Beautiful and light weight
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"I love everything about this laptop. Light weight, boots up within 10 seconds, very fast and smooth experience using it. Value for money. I got this for about 67k. Great laptop. I recommend to buy this laptop if you are looking for decent battery life, great performance and fast and smooth user experience."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"After using for about six weeks, I am sharing my experience: Performance wise laptop is absolutely fine. Boot in almost no time. After pressing power button you will be logged in by the time you finish saying ""Ready, 1, 2, 3, Go"". Fingerprint unlock is instantaneous. Heaviest software(s) open within few seconds. Normal software(s) like browser, adobe etc open like they were just minimized not closed. Wifi is superfast. Trackpad is buttery smooth with all standard gestures supported. Microphone and speaker are of high quality but volume is not high enough. If a normal ceiling fan is running at high speed then you may find it hard to listen the sound without headphone or external speaker. Battery is also just ok, not great. There are four modes of battery but 'best battery life' mode also drains quite fast. Now coming to the two big problems: 1. Laptop heats up even when you are not gaming or multitasking. Good cooling pad is must for using this laptop. 2. All three USB ports (including C type) are 'always ON'. So if you forget to switch off the cooling pad, it would continue running the whole time. Similarly if you forget to disconnect external HDD, it would continue running even after you shutdown the laptop.... and so on. This is the main reason for one star less in my rating. There are few other minor issues like (a) no LAN port, (b) USB ports on left side very close to each other, difficult to disconnect devices from one port without disturbing the other. (c) Power button is very oddly placed. In fact I like power button to be separate from keyboard, but even if it is part of keyboard, it should be on one corner of the keyboard. But here you get the power button after five keys from top right. So every time you will have to locate this to switch ON the laptop. (d) Hard disk fixed capacity, no additional slot for expansion. Only option may be to replace the SSD but then factory OS will be lost (I know license will not be lost but still it is not a very good option...). Edit: One more important point I want to highlight is that, as an academician, the permanent license of genuine MS office is the one of the biggest positives for me."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Laptop is good looking and fast. However it has heating issues from day one. I recommend not to use it without a cooling pad. I got it at 65k and I think it was a reasonable price. Fingerprint scanner, audio speakers, battery backup are all fine. Screen is ok. Not too good, not too bad. My last laptop with Dell had better screen."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"I am in love with the build quality and design, it's very elegant and sleek. The display is beautiful and can be seen clearly from any angles. The performance is amazing, the responses are quick. The camera is good too. The speakers however are below and the sound might get muffled at times other wise the sound quality is great. Battery backup is average, don't expect it to last more than 5-6 hours. I feel the need to keep the brightness on maximum in a well lit room. I used the laptop for casual games, I got more than 100 FPS on medium-high settings and 150+ on low settings. Mx 450 is good enough for light gaming.  One huge con of this laptop is that it heats up a lot while running heavy tasks such as running multiple platforms and meetings, or gaming. But with this light weight slim design it is expected of it. The dual fan cooling doesn't do much to help it.  Overall I love the laptop wouldn't change it for anything else. perfectly suits my needs."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"The device is delivering excellent performance as expected from the specs, but is a bit disappointed by the built quality. HP has tried to cover up the poor built quality with some excellent finish. On first look it does look premium, but once you hold it in your hand, it is obvious that the material is cheap. Battery, Screen Brightness are reasonably good as expected. Camera on the other hand is very poor. This would be good value at around 68k. Feels a bit overpriced at 73k+."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"So here is a review after 2 months of usage. After scouting many options, i had bought this laptop. So i will give my opinion on the following factors.  1) Design 9/10- Medium Weight, very aesthetic look, the Silver colour is the one i have and it looks really stunning.  2) Battery 8/10- I use the laptop for around 5 hours a day, and i need to charge it only 1 time. The battery is really great.  3) Display 7/10- It is not that great, if u are working near a window or some light falling on the sceen, it gets difficult viewing things.  4) Performace 9/10- The 16 GB Ram and the i5 11th Gen processor is superb, have never experienced lagging till date.  5) Editting 8/10- Have been using Photoshop since a month, and the 2GB Graphic Card performs quite good. There is a very slight lag though. But gets the work done perfectly."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"- Battery drain is faster - not suitable for gaming - it has got plastic body and build quality is ok - rest all is good, like screen, speaker, processor, RAM, etc - not sure about additional storage space, I can't find any information"
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,I have check my latop warranty at same day when diliver this laptop. And I see Warranty is only 10 months remains. Not satisfied with warranty.  Product is Perfectly suitable for programmer and designer.  And some people say that power button make issue when delete button use. I have test with all this scenario and no any issue with power button when laptop is ON. So free for this power button and delete button position.
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"The Ctrl key has come out within 2 days of usage. When HP is service is contacted, I was informed that this is not covered by waranty and I have to pay approx 4000 rupees to get the keyboard completely replaced. This is a clear case of manufacturing defect."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Pros: *Fast finger scanning. *Good sensitive TouchPad, even it has sensitivity on the click button. *Backlit keyboard with 2 step brightness adjustment. *Best hardware features. *Less than 3 seconds boot time. *Fast charging, 20-100% in 1 hour 15 minutes, 20-80% in 40 minutes.  Cons: *It is mentioned in the specification, it has 8 hours of battery backup for video. But I get only 3 hours. *UI of some application not compatible with display(application UI doesn't look sharp, but all other desktop icons, wallpaper and Manu look sharp)."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,Using for 4 months. So far so good! Only clear cut issue is blue light filter switches off if screen times out. There are couple of work arounds for that(set a schedule) but it was a small dissappointment in an otherwise awesome product. Very nice other wise! I do alot of heavy software dev work while running multiple tools/ides in parallel.
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"The product is really good, really fast, slim, good battery Cons GPU heat in high frame rate game (can be managed with cooling pad or ac room) Screen is not top level ~ average Gaming is really good for beginners Battery backup is really Good 67k ~ valve for money product"

HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Love the product... Premium build and colour... This is my first laptop with high end configuration (at least for me) turns on within 5 seconds and programs response is very fast thanks to the SSD and 16 GB ram... I played some high end games like snowrunner, tomb raider 2, GTA IV and there were no lags.  Slightly gets overheated when playing snowrunner and my cooling pad reduces it considerably (if you don't use cooling pad while playing high end games laptop may switch off, it did for me twice)... And this heating is not a big setback since it is not a gaming laptop... Overall it will worth your money (I bought it for 65K on Mar 2021) if you are looking for a laptop for multitasking"
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"What the hell is this When I’m unbox the laptop it’s full of ants in the laptop box,idk where the ants came from and idk what’s gonna happen for my new laptop,but the laptop was pretty cool.

HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,This is an awesome laptop that provides rock solid performance. The only drawback is that the battery life is pretty average. I haven't had a single instance of the PC having up or crashing in our 4 months of using the laptop

HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"The laptop has faulty charging system and the whole panel gives you this mild shock (earthing) while the laptop is on charge.

HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"We bought this laptop last week from hp website after reviewing many laptops. We are very much satisfied and thrilled with features. It is light weight, 16 GB RAM (6GB internal graphics) , 2 GB dedicated graphics, backlit keyboard, FHD resolution, RAM extendable up to 32GB. Battery may come around 5 hours I think.  It's the BEST. Blindly go for it."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Purchased this laptop 1 month back. After getting just 1 hour of battery backup and excessive heating. I tried to know the core problem because everything was perfect in terms of Hardware.  So The problem is Nvidia Graphic Card default Processes and Other Background application.  Perform the following steps to get the best battery backup and Minimal heating even with using battery Power Mode to Best Performance.  Step 1 Disable Background Apps Go to settings, search background apps, either close all the apps or close almost every app except Windows Defender and others if necessarily required. For me Mail and Calendar is important.  Step 2 (Disable Nvidia Container Service from Services) Search Services on start menu. Find NVIDIA Display Container LS ,first stop the service first and then disable it.  Wooho, restart your system see the changes. None of the steps mentioned above will impact laptop or Nvidia Graphic Card performance, if you face any issues you can anytime revert back the settings.  All the best. This is an Amazing laptop. Its just the processes running behind soaking the battery health."
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Not sure what to say actually some says best than Mac OS but I don't compare laptop which this brand with that whatever it is hp has a own identity and apple we can't compare their techniques are different you cannot expect an hp for apple. Cons : I am not a big fan of its battery life works around 2 hours I didn't like the audio much. Audio should be better as compared to the price range. Heats a lot even if there is a fan. Not recommended for areas where extensive sun light falls.  Display is average not too good as expected. Very heavy not comfortable. A lot of laging problem Overall not recommended for programer, or gaming small task like watching YouTube, Google, replying email is sufficient. I am not quite happy with the purchase. I would recommend you to take MacBook insteay"
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,Lid can be tilted only 110°. You won't get a good viewing angle when placed in a laptop stand for height. Brightness is just average. I doubt to see the screen if you use it outside building

HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,Slim and smart looking piece..easy to handle for longer work period also. Very nice screen.. Battery life is very good ( upto 6 to 7 hour for normal work). Graphic intensive gaming also work perfectly.. Finally it's very fast compared to whatever laptop u have use now.. Value for money..
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,Build quality is awesome and also performance is too good. Boot time is maximum 4 to 5 seconds. I think in this price rage this laptop is good. I bought it at 69000.
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,Overall it's good.  What I Like: 1. Bootup (within 3 sec.) 2. Screen 3. Processor 4. Speaker 5. Design  What can be improved/ don't like: 1. Build Quality (Plastic only) 2. Overheating 3. Battery Life (It's average 4 to 6 hours only)

HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,Battery backup poor but price is too high
HP-Pavilion-Graphics-39-62cms-15-eg0103TX,laptop,"Bought this one from the store as it was not available few days ago in Amazon. laptop's build quality is good. Pros- 16gb + 512gb nvme + nvidia MX450 Blazing fast. Took less than 3 sec to startup, thought it was in sleep mode but not. LoL Very sensitive fingerprint reader. Backlit keyboard (only white colour with 2 types of brightness control) 1.75kg is a decent weight for modern laptops. Nvidia MX450 is a good Gcard. 65 watt Fast charging is a good thing. Decent battery backup 5-6 hrs of using from 70% charge. Full HD IPS display. 250 nits. 60hrz refresh rate, 45% NTSC (it should be little bit higher upto today's mark)  Cons. Lacking of extra ports. No RJ45, only 2 usb 3.0 ports and one type c and a card reader which can't read SDHC card because you can't insert that. Price is little bit high. Most and probably the one question for everyone who want to buy this one is Can I upgrade the SSD or is there any extra slot for ssd or NVME? I HAVE NO IDEA!! I contacted with HP supprot to ask about ssd upgradable or not, they didn't answered.  Overall I am happy with this product of HP. The purpose for buying this laptop for me is serious editing works and office jobs. It has everything That I need. But I can say that you won't regret after buying this whatever your purpose of working. Let me know if any one buy this laptop and get any answer about upgrading ssd."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700J8IN,laptop,Definitely worth the money... Sleek and compact.  Pros: Backlit keyboard Fingerprint Screen is brilliant Sound is ok Dual channel 3200mhz ram (8gb)  Cons Definitely Not lightweight Gets warm at base.. you can feel it if kept on lap. it can be a good thing as heat dissipation works. Charger port is not USB c Battery life is 4-5 hrs of watching movie or binging. But quick charge covers this drawback. 0-60% in an hr.  Overall it's excellent for the price. (44k)  Please don't compromise on quality for price. This laptop has good built quality and provides 2 yr warranty.  Go for it blindly.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700J8IN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Nice product+very slim & light weight. Superb led lit keyboard.  Storage capacity seems less -239 GB SSD.

Superfast booting, thanks to 8GB/256GB SSD & core i3 , 11th gen. processor. Product Registration goes smoothly, for Windows10 as well as MSO. Warranty is for 2 years but, they calculate it from date of import, I guess, so I got for 1 year and 11 months only. IPS HD display is superb, crisp. Fingure recognition works well. Battery works for 5 hours plus for normal working. Power adapter is sturdy. Usable SSD available is 190 to 194 GB. Overall Value for money."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700J8IN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Hey Team,  Below are my observation about this product:  Good Things: 1. Specification wise one of the best laptops in this price range 2. Sleek and good body build 3. Looks premium and the keypad is nice  Bad Things: 1. I received an already opened laptop. I have attached a video that confirms this. 2. Wifi Issue - This is a persistent issue that I am facing since the day I received this laptop. I tried reaching out to Lenovo Customer care. In the very first response, they told that this is a known issue and happening with most of the laptops of this generation. This clarifies that this is a bug with this product. 3. Even after 7 days, after being diagnosed and fixed by Lenovo Support. I am facing the same issue. 4. No LAN PORT - Wifi is the only option to connect that means you need to think twice before buying 5. It's a 256 GB SSD laptop but please note that less than 190 GBs are available to use as OS consumes a lot of space.  It seemed to be a terrific buy but the above issues have made it worst."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700J8IN,laptop,Best product in this value range. The screen size may be little small for people used to working in 15 inch laptops but over time one gets adjusted to 14 inch screen. It's super light and easy to carry around.  Laptop boots up literally in seconds and the response time is superfast. A good value addition.

Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560424WIN9S,laptop,"First of all the product was not up to the mark as its boot time is very high and every single operation is taking too much time. Then the price fluctuation is there as I bought this laptop on 27.08.2021 at the price of 44,590 without any accessories but now they are giving this laptop at 43,990 with briefcase. This is the biggest issue that when I called them up for return they said they don't return policy. They said this product has replacement policy only. This product is not worth paying this much of amount and I cannot do anything about it."

Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560424WIN9S,laptop,"This model is best but only buy a model with a SSD or just add a 120gb ssd for 2600 Rupees later.  PROS- * Looks nice AF * core i3 11th gen is much better than some ci5 and ci7. * battery backup is very very good (6-7 hours on power saver mode). * speakers are fire. CONS- * some apps don't work at first (but this is a driver issue of windows 10). * display is very superior but there is some blurred text. (scaling issues i think) * i don't like keyboard layout, but may get used to it :)  just go for it, and install a 120gb cheap ssd :)"
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560424WIN9S,laptop,"The laptop is quite slow, it take almost 15 minutes to boot for the 1st time. There has been constant issues with WiFi and Microphone since the time I brought it, and it is just one month."

Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700HXIH,laptop,This is a great laptop at this price. Would highly recommend it. Athlon CPU is based on the Ryzen Architecture and is much faster than the Intel counterparts. RAM 4GB is soldered on-board. You can easily upgrade upto 20GB total. Would highly recommend upgrading to 8GB or 12GB. M.2 Slot is also present. Will highly recommend to add a 256GB NVME SSD. Laptop does not come with OS. This is a great laptop for those who want to run Linux. AMDGPU Open Source drivers work out of the box in most distros.
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics-82C700HXIH,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Brought this for my child online classes, but the speaker volume is very low - couldn't use for online classes without external speakers. Build quality is nice . Mic reception also poor . Screen resolution is good . Keyboard is ok but the power button comes within keyboard which is not good I think . Amazon delivery was on time . Very good packing . Processor is ok for online classes . Separate graphics memory of 500mb showing on task manager ."

HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Screen flickers while watching movies and there is disturbance like you see in old TV sets. Trying to contact HP but unable to do so.  Update: Got a replacement laptop but still the same issue. Still screen flickering. The issue is with netflix and prime as their video resolution does not match with this device as it has a diff screen size than a laptop.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"fantastic laptop there is only one con that you cannot use ppt, word, etc all other windows applications"
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Hybrid and simple verson of laptop Simple brouser.. entertainment.. and Android app .. if you are light user and not want windows then this is best for you... In this price range 360 and touchscreen is good..  Pros: -Price range -touch screen with 360degree -use most Android app  Cons: -Screen is 4:3 so u can not use full screen to view vedios - screen quality not upto mark -camara is 0.9pixle wich is ok for vedio calling but not more than that
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"Short review - An excellent portable laptop from HP with superior tablet and laptop support 2 in 1. Great B&O speakers, sturdy hinges, decent screen, great battery life and a full size keyboard and trackpad. Must buy!  Long review - So I have a hi-spec desktop at my office which I use primarily for all intensive jobs like video editing, photo editing, gaming, etc. I was using an iPad Air at home since the past 10 years. I was done with Apple and wanted to switch. I read about Chromebooks online and was immediately interested in purchasing one.  After doing some research I came across the HP line of Chromebooks. My budget was around 30k which was the price for a new iPad. After seeing a number of reviews and work around videos for the Chrome OS, I shortlisted the HP line. I found the x360 and there were two options available a 12 inch convertible or a 14 inch laptop. The 12 inch made sense to me as I was looking at a tablet style PC. It perfectly fit my budget and I bought it in a flash.  Received delivery from Amazon in one day which is as usual perfectly packed and on time as always.  Unboxing it was a delight and I was in love at first sight. Extremely sleek and stylish and I was logged into Chrome OS and ready to go within a few clicks. The speakers from B&O are a delight and the screen is decent for its price. Can't expect a 1080p or 4K at 30k. The keyboard is extremely comfortable and so was the trackpad.  A huge number of ports available and the USB C charging is a breeze. I use my OnePlus 7T Pro Warp charging cable to charge the X360. There is a stylus pen available from HPs website for 3.5k but I don't see myself using it so I didn't puchase it.  Twist the screen and it becomes a tablet! No accidental tocuhes and a great quality touch makes using this a delight. YouTube, play store apps, browsing, doodling, zoom calls, all available at your disposal.  I really don't have any cons at this moment but if I really have to be picky, I would want a better display but I know a higher screen resolution would mean lesser battery life.  If anyone is looking at doing basic tasks on their laptop and have a budget of 30k I would strongly suggest Chrome OS and Hp x360. If you are looking at a tablet and laptop experience together, go for this model or then choose the 14inch which is 5k cheaper but it's only a laptop.  Chrome OS is extremely easy to get used to and there are tons of videos online to take you through it.  Thanks HP and chrome OS for finally helping me to get rid of the useless iPad. Goodbye Apple."
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Good for online classes n browsing Two in one Tablet + mini laptop
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"My requirement was a device that takes care of my child's online classes during the pandemic and in future. I do not like windows and all the inherent security issues and extra cost for utilities and security mitigation. Linux would be too complicated for a kid hence chromebook is just right. There are a coupe of other HP Chromebooks at ~25k (touch screen / no TC) but those do not flip 360°. This one does and it is just the right size to be used as both tablet and laptop. The interface is fast and it runs most of the Android apps like Microsoft Teams and all the office applications. Configuring printer is easy. So a well rounded device. Battery lasts all day. The backlight keyboard allows working at night without disturbing others in the room. Build quality is good. Doesn't feel too plasticy. It is in use for several weeks now.As of now, I cannot find anything bad but will update in future if I do. Five stars all the way."
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,I am running from piller to post to get the stylus/Pen getting compatible to the laptop. It's so pathetic when information claims it is compatible but when I receive the laptop it's not getting compatible. Irony is HP tech support had no clue how to do it. How can Amazon go so far without checking the compantability of the systems.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Sometimes touch is not working when I am using in tablet mode and and some android apps are not working properly. I am tired of reaching out to hp customer service because I want to return it and get the refund. They said they will get back to me but they never did. Amazon only allows the replacement. I don't want to have same product it's not at all value for money.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"This is simply amazing laptop available at very good price.  Go for it but , before buying read below for my experience.  What is the purpose? It's for general computing, web surfing, Web conferencing (Google Meet, Zoom, MS Teams, etc.), simple document editing. Not for high end computing, games, programming, etc.  I bought it for kid's school online classes. I have MS Teams Android app and Zoom installed. It works perfectly well for this purpose.  But if you or your kids are used to windows then it might take some time getting used to. Remember this is Chrome OS. If you are Android user it will be very easy to get adjusted.  You can install Android apps and get most of the normal work done.  If you install MS Office Android app, thinking it's free like on phone, then you are in for a surprise. MS Office free version of Android App requires subscription on this device. If you have subscription it will work. Nevertheless, Google Apps (Docs/Sheets/Slides) is good for me. I am very comfortable with it. Although children initially complained lack of MS Office, eventually they got used to Google apps.  You will have to get used to different keyboard shortcuts. They are not like windows.  The screen ratio is 4:3. So if you want to watch movies on this device then it may not be a good experience as this is not wide screen ratio. Give it a try, go ahead and install Netflix Android app and watch movies.  You can fold the screen completely and use it like a tab. Chrome OS has multiple virtual desktops so in tablet mode (and laptop mode as well) you can switch between seeing meeting screen and taking notes.  Battery life is very good. At least 6-7 hrs. Really you don't have to switch off the machine through the day, but do give it rest from time to time, as this is a consumer class machine not the business class machine.  You have to get used storing all your work (documents) in Google Drive. I have not figured out a way to store them locally but I think you can store your work locally as well.  This thing can also run Linux (beta is available). So if you are brave go ahead and try. BTW developers out there can also run VS Code as Linux app. I have not tried though.  It's storage is like on phone. It's not SSD. So do not expect SSD  I wish : It had more Storage. (You can have SD card, just like in phone) It had more RAM"
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Not working . bought 20 days back and started giving problem . waste of money.no worth
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"This is my first product review on Amazon, but given my terrible experience, I had to share my views here. I got this machine for my child’s online school classes - very moderate use overall. Within 3 months of purchase , the in built mic stopped working . I called up HP Service - and they told me it would take 3 working days(!) for an engineer to contact me . The laptop is now in the service Center as the faulty part has to be replaced . Overall , a poor product backed by a poor service experience.  Also , the online HP support for chromebooks is awful, compared to what they have for windows machines  My first and last HP notebook ! Never again"
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,As mentioned in the product description this model supports stylus pen and it should be bought separately - I bought one HP USI stylus pen. The USI HP stylus pen that I bought separately supports on the other Chromebook but not on my Chromebook(this purchased product).  Even went to HP service center but no response till date.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Good Product. My daughter loves it. Like an enormous tab with a keyboard. Can be flipped and used either as a laptop or a tab. Parent supervision app is useful.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"Best value for money in this range. So far so good..working well. Sound is good, display is fair( could have been better). Crome OS is fast and minimalistic. Some apps like zoom are not supported by playstore but crome browser has zoom support."
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,It is a very smart laptop and has impressive features and the battery life and sound quality is amazing! But it glitches sometimes and the body is very weak
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"well computer is okay for light use, but do not expect it to be windows. despite both from google, its particularluy difficult to transfer files and photos between your phone and computer, i did not find anything mentioning this fact anywhere in my research. overall good for surfing internet and watching videos. documentation, which i thought i would need a simple computer for is also hindered by lack of file transfer between the phone and the computer. overall one may use some web based apps and usb cable to transfer files, pics and videos. but impossible to send via bluetooth like you normally do! wtf"
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Body is so fragile.keyboarb letters are dull.os after update unstable.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"I'm very much disappointed with the build in quality and the screen. The laptop is heavy too. The screen is like an basic LCD monitor.

HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"It's just like a big android phone, not possible to work with Microsoft Word n excel. There is no exchange offer too on the product."
Vivobook-X515MA-EJ001T-Silver-Intel-Celeron,laptop,this pc is soo good
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"This is a GREAT Chromebook. Having used 2 other Chromebooks exclusively over the past 5 years, I have fallen in love with ChromeOS, and this is a clear step up from my previous Chromebook.  Pros:  1. Screen aspect ratio. Having been forced to use 16:9 aspect ratio screens for the passed decade, it is a joy to have a 3:2 aspect ratio screen. The screen on this is 1366 x 912 (the website incorrectly states the screen is 1366 x 768). I finally have enough vertical pixels! It is amazing how much difference 912 vertical pixels makes over the usual 768. This is the only Chromebook I know of in this price range that offers a 3:2 aspect ratio screen!  2. Backlit keyboard. Never having used a backlit keyboard before, I am enjoying being able to work in low-light conditions.  3. Tablet mode. This is my first exposure to a Chromebook which converts to a tablet. It is convenient to fold the screen back and use as a tablet.  4. Construction. Seems well built. I have only had it for 10 days. Time will tell how well it holds up. I stayed away from the Lenovo Flex Chromebooks because of the problems they have with their hinges. This HP x360 looks like it has robust hinges.  Cons:  1. Weight. It is a little heavier than my 2-yr old 11-inch HP Chromebook 11 G6 EE. Though it is much lighter than my 5-yr old HP Chromebook 14 G4.  2. Small screen bezel. When holding the screen by the edges, I sometimes accidentally trigger a touch action on the screen. I need to train myself in adjusting the screen angle without my fingers touching the touch sensitive part of the screen."
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Not really an issue with the chromebook but probably ChromeOS. The zoom app and web access is quite buggy and unreliable. Either the video blacks out or the audio and a number of features like gallery view are unavailable. Purchased this for my kid's school classes but had to return because of zoom not working. Please do your research on this topic (whether this bug has been fixed by ChromeOS) before buying.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Excellent hp chrome book. Light weight. Very fast. 100% better than a windows laptops. 4 GB RAM & 64 GB ROM.

HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Within 2nd day of use the laptop got slow... And frequently hangs... Very disappointed... Now return window has also been closed.... Amazon should compensate for this..

Overall the product is good for kids for reading purpose and browsing."
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Its 360° rotatable.. I got a good product. Works perfectly fine in my case according to my needs.. (No windows jhanjhay... If you are not a very tech person.. You can go for it..) Sound quality is good.. Can work as a tablet (cant make calls i guess). Its beautifull. And cute. I got it in offer for ₹26990. The offer lasted less than 24 hours i guess. Lol
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"Not user friendly, it is for children.you cant do offce work.just big size mobile.wastage of money.not easy to use like other laptops."
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Within 20 days of receiving the chrome book it's not switching on. Sent to service center they informed issue with mother board. It has to be replaced. Then after 15 days I receive the product back from service center now mic is not working and it doesn't shut down always shows white screen. The service center says now they have stopped the service for chrome book. It's the worst product with worst service. Can you believe I bought on 27th July and had to send it to service center Within 20 days. And received it on 31st August after service and still not working.  I will suggest to those who are planning to buy this please avoid this product. The used in the product are of very low quality witch won't last long. After paying 30 k for it . It doesn't even work for 20 days.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Its a new generation product and preety fast. This is fast enough to serve my purpose. May be i. Future we are going to choose chromebook over windows for every purpose.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Great product if you would like to have a tablet and laptop function for your daily use. Kids are loving it as well. Have a question. If I check the warranty in HP website its showing for 9 months and not for 12 months. Why it is?
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,it is good product to buy battery life is so good and it is so light weight and it is lighter than my macbook pro 15 inch m1 and is well for gaming also i have asphalt 9 in the laptop it is not lagging
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"The unit I received had a loose trackpad and dead pixels on the screen. Apparently the loose trackpad is a common issue on x360 models. Nevertheless the build quality was quite good, felt solid, speakers were fine, display was grainy from angles, but seemed fine looking straight on, touch screen was fine and OS responsible. But ended up returning due to the defects mentioned above"
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,system was not working please advise hp service center in vishakapatnam
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,Worst experience from hp Chromebook x360°. Power button sideways didn't even worked. And then i filled replacement or refund but Amazon didn't even heard my complain... But now i am happy with Asus vivobook.
HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,"Starts up in 2 secs, shuts down in 2 secs. No softwares installed to hinder the response , so it is lightening speed. No big hard disk, light battery makes it light weight. If we get used to working from the documents in cloud and Android apps, then there is nothing better than this."

HP-Chromebook-12b-ca0010TU-Touchscreen-Integrated,laptop,This is one of the best Chromebook available right now. It's good to hold and feels premium as well. Build quality is great and battery life is also as expected. This review is based on a week's usage.
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"After 4 days of using for office work  Pros: - The laptop is fast in terms of boot speed and application launch due to the SSD. - Powerful processor (AMD Ryzen 5300u). - Battery life is good. Did 7+ hrs on a single charge . - Speaker is loud. - Under light usage, the laptop was running silent and cool. Did not experience noticeable heat while using on the lap for long hours.  Cons: - The display is SVA, the viewing angles and colors are not good. {common in this price range). - No backlit keyboard and the silver color makes it less easy to see the letters on the keyboard. - The laptop won't open at 180 degrees which may be a deal-breaker for some.  Comments: The 14 inch model has a better display(IPS) and backlit keyboard but is slightly costly. It is difficult to find another device with such specs in this price range. Would have appreciated a fingerprint reader."
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"Thr built quality is good. Speakers are much louder. Processor is good. It contains Samung 8Gb ram, which is pretty fast. The laptop restarts innjust 10 secs which is quite fantasic. windows updates install faster without any glitch. The lap doesn't slow down even after the updates. But one thing I felt cheated was the laptop's MRP is 44500, but the seller's are trying to portray higher MRP in the website, some sellers are selling the same laptop for 49999,55000, 59999,"
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Backlit keyboard not available
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"First of all, very good service by Amazon. Got this package before delivery date.  People are complaining about this laptop having a SVA display...see, it does not make a difference. It very similar to a IPS panel. Just dont view it from extreme angles.  Should opt this laptop instead of the hp14s variant for 4 reasons:  -it has Samsung company's ram which is excellent while the 14s has hynix company's ram which is below average.  -it has anti-glare screen which do not put a strain on your eyes. You should prefer anti-glare + sva panel rather than IPS + no anti-glare.  -it has a full size keyboard with numpad is 15.6 inches.. backlit keyboard is unecessary if you type fast without looking.. backlit keyboard is only for doing show off....  -this laptop is available everywhere (flipkart, amazon, Reliance digital, vijay sales, croma etc) while the 14s one is not available anywhere and is very difficult to find.  Rest all is the same"
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"The latest Ryzen 5000 series processors have really left behind the Intel i3 ones, even the 11th gen. But the thing is that HP did cut some features in this model by giving a non IPS SVA panel (although antiglare) and also the keyboard is not backlit. The thing with HP keyboards is that they are totally silver colored and so without backlit, it is sometimes tricky to type even during day time. Better get a usb light (very cheap) which will solve the issue. Also the battery backup is not bad being a 41Whr one, you will get 5 hours with moderate usage. I bought this as my backup laptop and so haven't been using much, but still this is a beast at the price of 43k (even less if you exchange your old laptop)!"
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"The laptop exceeded my expectations. It is super fast and the keyboard and keypad experience is extremely satisfying. When I opened the laptop for the first time, Windows 10 configuration was done in a very impressive manner. The screen is with anti glare feature which is very important. The screen is SVA. HP should define what SVA stands for. If it means standard viewing angle then it is not great. However, if it means superior vertical alignment as developed by Samsung, then it is great. Anyway, I did not pay much attention to this aspect. More important reason to buy this laptop is its RYZEN 3 5300 processor. It is based on 7 nm architecture and consumes less power than i3 11th generation processor. Hence, it is more battery efficient. It has also 4 cores. The audio quality is superb. Overall, I am very satisfied. Those who do not need backlit keyboard and value antiglare screen can blindly go for this."
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"Pros: 1. You get the new Ryzen 3 5300u processor based on Zen2. Therefore has greater performance and efficiency than the older Ryzen 3 3250u. And way better than 11th gen core i3 in this price range . 2. Decent build quality. 3. 512 GB Kingston SSD. There is no extra SSD slot though. 4. Boots up very quick thanks to the SSD 5. Setup was fast and simple. No crashes or BSoD. You will require a Microsoft account after which Windows and Office will be activated. 6. Included Microsoft Office Home and Student edition. Will activate once Microsoft account is linked. 7. Speakers are front firing decently loud speakers . 8. 8 GB of single stick 3200 MHz RAM. Has an additional slot for future addition. 9.Battery life seems okay. Will update review after more days of usage.  Cons: 1. Display HP is providing a 'SVA' LCD display instead of IPS or LED display. And what's even more annoying is the 'SVA' display is actually a TN LCD display. HP calls it SVA as Single Viewing Angle. Don't confuse it with the actually better super vertical alignment displays from Samsung. The viewing angles are not that great. And as expected TN panels don't have good color accuracy either. Colors look washed out. If you are looking for a laptop with good display, I would suggest you to look at other laptops. 2. No backlit keyboard. 3. No fingerprint scanner even though HP website has it listed as such. Not much of a con for me, but may be for you. 4. McAfee bloatware is present. Thankfully you can uninstall it completely. Use the already existing AntiVirus Windows defender in Windows 10. No need to use any other antivirus software.  I would recommend this laptop easily for office use and mild gaming. Absolute great hardware only let down by a mediocre display.  For 42k, this seemed like a good deal to me. If you don't have a requirement for a higher quality display, you can absolutely go for it. The rest of the hardware provided is great for this price range.  Overall, a 4/5 for me."
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"There is no IPS panel. So you will face trouble with color inaccuracies. There is no backlit keyboard. So I'd recommend you to buy the 14 inch model as it comes with IPS panel and backlit keyboard. Otherwise the laptop is a beast in this price range, and so is the 14 inch one. I'm writing this review after 6 days of use."
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Obviously the laptop is hp which is ideal for long term uses and a top brand. I got the exact things what I expected from ryzen 3 5300u which is superfast and battery effecient.All the main components and performance is great beyond expectations except the display and body of the laptop.The display is sva instead of ips and whole body is plastics that i feels not comfortable when handling due to its flexibility
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"Product was packed to the perfection. It's value for money. The startup time is around 40seconds. Has a decent battery backup. Lifetime Microsoft home and student is beneficial. Just opening up word, excel or ppt activated the subscription. If you are looking for office purpose or education around 45k go for it."
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Backlit keyboard is not available but everything else is perfect.At this price range this laptop is perfect
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Silver model is a nightmare when it comes to using the keyboard. The letters on the keys are barely visible.
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"The product is great, the screen quality is awesome. The processor & SSD are really fast. It boots up under 5 seconds. The trackpad is very smooth & big. Speakers are loud & voice is also good. Overall a must buy."
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,the viewing angle are average but good ⚡
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Too high price as per quality of product.
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This a good quality of laptop in this price. Screen quality is very good .I am satisfied with this laptop and the sensor of touch pad iss also good
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,All specs and performance are excellent.. except IPS Display missing
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Sound quality is nice so is the processor.
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Performance is best.
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Overall love 💗💗💗💗 it
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Could have IPS panel and backlit keyboard. Everything else is ok at this price range.
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Good product
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"Exactly after warranty period, SSD needed to be changed. Also HP customer service charges 1799/- promising to resolve the issue, but did nothing. Ultimately I ended up to repair it from outside costing me around rs.8000/-. This product is not recommended at all."
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,"Amazing value for money.  Pros :  1) 5300u - 4Core processor performs better than i3 11gen, i5 8thgen, 4300u, 3250u. 2) Boots Up in 5sec ; Fast read and write speeds. 3) 3200mHz 8gb fast ram with one extra slot for future upgrades. (Upto 16gb) 4) Pre-installed MS. Office lifetime.  Cons :  1) Display is average. Good enough for daily tasks but not for color accurate work like Photoshop. 2) No backlight, which might be a issue. 3) No BT 5.0  Verdict : Power packed deal at a price of 42000!"
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Guys in this laptop only hdd is there not ssd please beware before buying hope you understand my point 🙄🙄
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Bought this laptop recently. Read earlier review. Very fast laptop with amd ryzen 5000 series processor. Best laptop in 45k budget. Good luck finding HP14s varient 😂 it is unavailable everywhere
HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15s-eq2042AU,laptop,Not value for money. Too much price for rygen 3 .Even if it is 5th generation but other qualities are not upto the mark..
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Batter life is even worst than my 4 year old mobile of 1+ 6T Good in looks n other gaming stuffs.. lil heavy.. we hv to clean the dust every now n then due to black color..camera is not upto the mark... But at this range it is better th other
Dell-Inspiron-3505-Integrated-D560361WIN9B,laptop,Third class service being given by amzon & it's being services being detoriated day by day. There is no etiquettes being followed by the customer service agents. Misleading information being given on different calls. Refund time taken is longer than usual. No clarity about the information. Worst experience.
Dell-Inspiron-3505-Integrated-D560361WIN9B,laptop,I like the Screen and body
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I am giving this review after two days of usage. This product is really good, when I took this product, there was no review in it. So now when we talk about its review, it is really good. The booting time is only 9 seconds, the graphics is quite awesome. There is no issue of heating even in this summer month. Battery backup is 7 hours in normal use, the full time is 3 to 3½ hours with video and 2 to 2 and a half hours if you talk with the game. The sound quality is quite good. The keyboard light is quite attractive. Overall speaking, this is a very good product, yes you can go for it."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"As usual, amazon sent the item with good packaging. [ MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE WARRANTY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE YOU GET THE LAPTOP SO THAT IF YOU CANNOT RESOLVE THE WARRANTY YOU CAN RETURN THE LAPTOP IF IT IS WITHIN THE RETURN WINDOW WHICH STARTS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY ] This laptop is very good and very fast but a bit heavier. It has a mat finish so it is also a fingerprint magnet. Apart from these two everything else is good about this laptop.  But I am going to write about the main issue I had faced that is WARRANTY. After setting up the laptop HP Assitance Center was showing I have only 9 months of warranty left. It is a very common issue nowadays if bought online. But to fix it you need to do the following steps  1. Open the Hp Support Assistant 2. Click on support resources 3. Click -> Chat with an Expert 4. Then your default browser will open and after giving some info like phone number and email id chat will be started. BUT BEFORE STARTING THE CHAT GET THESE FOLLOWING THINGS READY : 4.1. Invoice 1 [Can be downloaded from amazon invoice menu that appears on the order] 4.2. P-slip/Warranty 1 [Can be downloaded from amazon invoice menu that appears on the order] 4.3. Printable Order Summary [Can be downloaded from amazon invoice menu that appears on the order] 4.4. Picture of a portion of the laptop where the serial number is printed which should match with the serial number provided in P-slip/Warranty 1[Step. 4.2.]  5. If you have done step 4 just provide the following text with your own details. I purchased [HP Pavilion Gaming - 15-dk0268tx] from Amazon on [YOUR PURCHASE DATE] which is delivered by [DELIVERY DATE]. My laptop Serial Number: [YOUR LAPTOP SERIAL NUMBER] and Product Number:[YOUR LAPTOP PRODUCT NUMBER]. But while checking the warranty on HP Support Assitant it is showing only [YOUR REMAINING WARRANTY] months of warranty left starting from [YOUR INVALID WARRANTY START DATE] and ending on [YOUR INVALID WARRANTY END DATE]. But it should show 1 year of warranty from the date of purchase (i.e. invoice date) from Amazon which is [YOUR PURCHASE DATE], and warranty status should show 1 year left.  6. They will send you a mail with case ID while chatting and they will ask you to reply to that mail with all the related documents attached.[specified in step 4]  7. And if everything goes well they will send you an SMS with confirmation that the warranty date will be updated and will be reflected within 24 to 48 hours. Luckily in my case, it took 14 hours.  Still, Amazon and HP both are good at providing their service but Amazon SELLER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE WARRANTY ISSUE before selling the product. This SAME ISSUE IS FACED BY ANOTHER COLLEAGUE OF MINE.  Pheeeewwwwww. That's all folks."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Best Performance Laptop Even tested Far Cry 5 , The graphics is awesome and ssd is there so no issues in Speed. Loving ittttttt.."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Overall performance of laptop after 1week of use is better.. Booting time excellent, keypad is good, touchpad is quite noisy from one corner but overall it works smoothly than other laptop."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"On the first day of usage, SSD makes the fast booting. while checking the warrenty on hp website using the serial no . its showing the warrenty is alreday strated from 11 jul 2020.but we brought the device from amazone on 11-oct -2020. it seems old stock or second hand. can any one help to reoslve the issue"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,within 15 days it is dead... the return window closed.. the laptop not charging and not turning on.. it is very disappointing for me... don't know what to do... please amazon look in the matter
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"This laptop is decent for gaming and everyday use. If gaming is your primary concern, you won't regret buying this.  Pros: 1) Can play all the latest games like Marvel's Avengers, Mafia Definitive Edition etc smoothly 2) Boot time is very less (less than 10 seconds) and the SSD makes it fast with the RAM. 3) The black colour looks really decent, if needed can keep light on keypad keys on but I won't recommend it as it can drain battery  Cons:  1) The camera quality is not good, can see grains literally 2) Weight is on the higher end and need to be careful 3) Oil or smudge on hand can be easily seen on this laptop (recommend using external USB keyboard and mouse both). 4) The charger port is on the right side and this gets a bit to be used to though it's good for some. 5) A big drawback is at this price range MS office and one year McAfee is not there ( a few days trial period at this price is not justifiable) 6) The charger gets bit heated with long usage and the laptop fans keep it cool unless gaming is on ultra high settings."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"It's been a month I'm using this laptop and trust me.. budget wise it's the best! I play csgo mostly and sometimes flight simulation.. csgo it gives about 150 to 180fps on ultra high which is more than enough for a 60hz screen.. and on microsoft flight simulator 2020..I use high end settings which is one level down to ultra max and it's very smooth with a decent fps of 45 to 70 and hardly any stuttering.  Imo , buy it if you are low on budget but want a decent gaming laptop.  csgo: 150 to 180fps Xplane 11: 50 to 70fps Microsoft flight simulator 2020: 45 to 70fps"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,After 1 month of use i am writing review. Pros: 1- full charge in 2hours 2- backup of 5hrs for normal use and 3hrs for gaming 3-good for gaming 4- keys quality is nice.  Cons: 1- only ssd but 500Gb is enough for normal use. 2-price
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Stopped working after 6 days so don't go for this product and faced so many issues in laptop returns and when finally product returned and recived my payment.So overall I am highly unsatisfied with service from seller and Amazon and finally I think we should not buy costly products from Amzon from this seller.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Now, I'm regretting buying this laptop  Cons :-  1) There is only one SSD , it is not divided ; which means if in future your laptop gets infected ( virus ) , all data will get erased.  2) Extremely low battery backup. It lasted roughly 2.5 hours on normal use. I dont now what is going to happen after 1 - 2 yeas.  3) Purely made of plastic.  4) In hand SSD you will get is only 427 gb.  5) Camera is very extremely low quality & Megapixels.  Rest other features are good. In my opinion, better to look for another laptop."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I ordered this laptop on 1st of September and got it on 2nd of September. It has been 3 days. This laptop runs really smooth. The screen is an anti glare one. Body is matte black. Gives a very good look. MS office is pre installed Really, a good deal at this price. The only down side is that the storage is 516gb and not 1tb, but otherwise it is something which you can really invest and not regret it. You need to keep this laptop clean, since it matte black any kind of stain like sweat and oil can be seen easily."

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"The performance is so damn impressive. I did not experience any thermal throttling while playing farcry-5 for 5-6 hours in ultra settings. The thermal is controlled very well.  The booting time is just 7-8 seconds as it has SSD.  The only thing is the battery don't last in performance mode and battery life can be improved by changing the battery settings.  There is a ""HDD slot"" available for upgrade.  The speaker are not up to the mark but decent one.  I am very happy that I choose this one over dell g3 mainly because of the thermal performance."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Product is great But the packing was not upto the mark
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,The product comes with no warranty card. So it is unreliable
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"First off, this item is sold in India only by Amazon retailers. You won't find this on offline stores because it's not made for India.  Heat dissipation is lovely for laptop but not the 150W charger. It's gets tremendously heated. I haven't played heavy games in it but I ran Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Premiere Pro at the same time. It doesn't lag per se but while my external 5 TB HDD is plugged in, the system gets a little slow. I have felt that. Display is beautiful, ofcourse 60Hz matter. The system font is gorgeous, very Helvetica-ish. Color reproduction is a tad bit less saturated although you'd feel that only in daylight (because of low valuation of knits). Contrast is perfect for the display.  It takes 4 smooth seconds just for the laptop to boot up with 80% of the inbuilt storage empty. It's a beautiful piece of technology, SSD.  IF YOUR BUDGET SUITS THIS, DEFINITELY GO FOR THIS PRODUCT"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Very bad ...they have only old item ...they delivered damaged not working product ...even not refund
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Ealier, I was using Macbook pro and i had to buy another laptop. I was very confused which laptop would be suitable for me? I decided to buy a laptop with following configurations (under my budget): Atleast 8 GB ram, SSD, high clock speed, and no heating issue. After using the MacBook, this laptop did not feel smooth to me. Touch pad is not good at all. For me, linux OS is most suitable OS. I installed ubuntu 18.04 and it works perfecrly. During installation, i faced no issue. After 2 months of use Good thing: 1). On Linux OS, speed is much better 2). With i5, 9th generation, 8 GB RAM, and 500 GB SSD, this system brings attention to most beginners. It has 4 cores and 8 threads. Not that good: 1). The touchpad is not good. It may be not as good a Macbook but I think it is good enough to use. 2). I am feeling some problems with charging. Sometime after connecting with the charger, I have to wait for few seconds. Sometimes, I have to rotate the cables in the charging port. 3). Even after using B&O sound speaker, the sound is not as good as I expected. The sound of the speaker is very low. 4). The backlight of the keys is little bit irritating. A white light would have been much better."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"The laptop has some great specs like 9th Gen Intel Core i5 Processor 15.6-inch Laptop (Core i5-9300H/8GB/512GB SSD/Windows 10 Home/4GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Graphics. The laptop boots super fast in seconds and turns off equally fast. However, what disappointed was 1. The expiry of “hp” warranty was upto September 2021 whereas it should be upto Jan 2022. Seems I got an already activated laptop 2. The battery drains so fast that it didn’t last even 2 hours. 3. Laptop was delivered in a huge box on a bike. Lucky that it didn’t break while in transit I would suggest to go for something else rather than this model"

As usual, impressive pricing and delivery timing from Amazon. Packaging from Amazon's side was abysmal. They packed a costly item in a large carton box which was too big for thr laptop and yet didn't even offer any cushioning at all.  About the laptop - boots like a charm, runs like a charm, amazing bang for the buck very honestly. Will update this review after 3 months for more."

Horrible service. And If you buy Any HP laptop online (amazon or flipkart), you wont be eligible for any Hp Promotional offers and Hp customer folks suggesting to buy from partner stores.  Never ever buy from Hp...But laptop is good."

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,I liked the way it boots up. No lag at all. The only thing that I felt negative about is the storage space.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I ordered this for my brother who works as a programmer. The battery life is awesome. It lasts over 4-5 hours after charging when he is working.  Sometimes even more with low brightness. With gaming, constantly it runs for 3-4 hours(in battery saving mode) In full performance mode, it lasts for around 2.5 hours.  I was sceptical about it at first, but it turned put to be an awesome performing laptop. I am an IT professional as well so I did thorough research before purchasing it.  The chip design in this laptop is similar to 10th gen i5, even though this is 9th gen i5. However, this has better clock speed and a better graphic support.  Color is very unique and keyboard layout is mind blowing.  It turned put super awesome for me."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Looks: Design of this Laptop is Awesome.What I like most about it is speaker grills and cooling vents design on top and back. The glowing LED illuminated power button is very aesthatic.  It is most suitable for office purpose as well as gaming purpose due to its amazing looks.  Performance: Due to the SSD the booting time is very very less. It takes just 5-8 seconds to boot.  It has i5 processor 9th generation 9300H where ' H' indicates graphics oriented which is most advantageous for graphical tasks like gaming and editing multimedia etc.  8GB Ram is provided with this laptop in which only 6-7.5 GB is usable.  512 GB SSD is more enough for bigger softwares which are to be installed within SSD for faster performance than HDD.  Graphic card ' nvidea Gtx 1650' performance is very good while gaming and some rendering tasks.  Thermal management is very good in this laptop. When you feel more heat on this laptop the fans spin faster and cools it rapidly.  Battery backup is not pretty good as it is common issue in gaming laptops
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Good laptop with great specs but the build is plastic and this model does not come with violet backlight but a white backlight
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"As everyone else pointed, the performance is incredible with regards to gaming and other stuff. But the only disappointment comes with usable SSD space of around 476 GB which is too low for a laptop of this kind. When you have a game like GTA 5 which alone requires 30GB, it can easily run out of space. Another bad thing is it doesn't have any slot to put additional SSD. It only has empty hdd slot but I believe putting an hdd will make this already bulky laptop more heavy and not to forget the additional power consumption due to mechanical nature of hdd."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I purchased Laptop on 23.02.21, but when I checked warranty of the same on HP support page, it shown Oct-21 (only 8 months). Then I contacted HP support through mail by giving invoice copy and P slip. HP support given reply we can’t update warranty of this Laptop as it was switched on before sale. I have taken up matter with Amazon for replacement with above reason and seller has replaced the laptop. For the replaced Laptop, warranty shown Oct-21. Then I contacted HP support through whatapp by giving invoice copy and P slip, they have updated my laptop warranty as Mar-2022. Laptop has very good configuration at this price 57990. Backlit should be of other color.  Best Laptop for using high end software’s like Ansys, Autocad etc."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Specifications for this price range: Design: 10/10 Gaming: 7/10 Performance: 7/10 RGB: Single color only no effects Weight: Slightly weighted Battery: 9/10  Pros: -gives Alienware feel -best for work in this price -ssd build  Cons: -Build Quality is LOW -60hz only -ram 8gb only in this price range 16gb is acceptable with i5 9th gen
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Poorest performance and cheap display looks like kalaignar TV
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"writing the review after 15 days. The product delivered is exactly matching with the description on Amazon app. Very first I would like to mention is it's Boot up time. it's very fast, with in 10 to 12 seconds we will get the login window. Display quality is good. keyboard is quite easy to use. The backlit feature of keyboard is really nice and easy on, off or dim light on f5 button. Rest all parts are working fine like SSD hard disk, RAM , HDMI port, bluetooth 5, wifi dual band etc.. Couple of drawbacks, first is web camera quality is not so great and second is the USB ports are very hard to operate... Overall all good buy 👍"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I am an architect and have been finding right pc for me since very long, after going through a lot of options finally purchased this one and I am so glad I did. I am using it since a month now It works amazingly, the graphics are good, it doesn't take much to open any arch softwares, battery is good, easy to carry, all the features are superbly working.."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Very nice laptop for overall college usage (MSO pre-installed). Gaming has no issues, playing on 144hz display feels very good. Battery backup I'd say is average 2.5-3hrs(just surfing). 512 gb ssd is not enough for me, if it's enough for you then it's worth buying !"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Hi All, Please refrain from buying this Laptop @Amazon, pretty expensive and all the card offers / cashback was turned down after payment. There were no accessories with the Laptop. Looks like a returned piece. When addressed to customer care, they denied to support. Other online shopping has competitive rates with genuine accessories."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Great specs, boots up fast and delivered on time. Using it for my office purpose and so not sure about the gaming performance. The laptop looks pretty, not too thick and the weight is also ok. One thing i didn't like, it has sharp edges and corners. The display is good since it has FHD IPS antiglare screen with 60 Hz refresh rate which is ok for me. The sound is loud since the speakers are on top. The keyboard looks great with the colored backlight and has seperate number keys. The trackpad is good too. The warranty started 2 months before the actual purchase date, I have raised a dispute with HP regarding this. Overall a good laptop which suits my requirement."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Before telling about pros and cons. I want tell one point regarding model number. On the back side of laptop the model number is written as 15-dk1148tx. But in hp customer support after adding this device, model number is showing like 15-dk0000. Pros: 1. Performance wise good and very smooth in operation. 2. It's supporting design software like Creo, Fusion 360, Altair inspire. If we increase ram up 16 GB it will give better performance. Good for mechanical engineers Cons: 1. Battery is very poor, it is lasting only up three hours 2. Model number is showing different in hp support."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Best laptop for gaming at this price. Camera quality is as usual nothing special. Battery life is good when not gaming. Boot up speed is fast thanks to ssd. You need to update it's warrenty. As default this product's warrenty starts from date of manufacturing but in real it starts from day of purchase so just talk with hp customer care.
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Great computing machine with an amazing price.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"The laptop got delivered quick and safely by Delhivery💯. The laptop is built well and feels solid. Be careful when you open the laptop as the hinge is in the center and it seems fragile. Battery life is alright for a gaming laptop. The camera quality is really poor for 2021. The back panel gets smudged with fingerprints really quickly so you will have to always clean it. Overall, a solid and genuine laptop. For some reason the warranty of my laptop got activated before I got the laptop. So I contacted HP support and within 2 days they fixed it."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,This go laptop is probably best in category becaof it’s price and improved design. Gaming laptops can heat up quickly damaging the motherboard. However this laptop has better design to accommodate the vents at back of the laptop. It helps. Laptop is not heating even after almost & hours of continuous working. Would have been more happy if HP would have given 11 th Gen at this price
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,A good internal specifications product with low wearing body and keys. Purple keyboard light is not very helpful in low light. The 15 in width hides the fact that the height has been reduced and plastic edge filler used. Keys are wearing out within less than warranty period. Please do not buy this product as the key wearing is very bad. Warranty says cosmetic issue. So even if all print comes off till plastic in first few months of warranty it is your problem not a manufacturing defect. I urge you to buy DELL or ASUS or even Thinkpad. From experience they do not have this issue
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Pros: 1. Performance beast. 2. Good for gaming, video editing, and heavy computation software. 3. Small and compact. 4. Actually It as 2 ram slots. 5. Better to upgrade ram becz all in-built softwares take half of the ram 4gb out of 8gb ram  Cons: 1. Laptop is not big as we see in picture. 2. Don't buy combo with bag. Becz bag quality not good."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Go for it youll be amazed looking at the laptop.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Seller sending defective and used laptops.. this is the second laptop I have ordered from the seller both are having touchpad issue. Very poor from Amazon
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,I like the laptop except the Webcam. It performs poor in low light condition. Rest of the thing is good. Also I want to know why my warranty period starts from August even when I bought this laptop in December. Please clarify me on this !!
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,I like the look good But battery 🔋 very fast discharge Warranty is 6 month in hp assistant battery showing I reset the laptop 3 time After installing softwares Start menu bar not working and system software also not working Pls reply me and give solution to my email address indoaircontechnos@gmail.com
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,The laptop stopped working in exactly 7 days after the warranty... HP very well calculated.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Good quality, light weight,silent...Good value for money.....Thermals are really good. Fans are silent....The keyboard is good...touch pad is good...The camera is really really bad....Microphone is fine.....Battery is okay for a gaming laptop....Speakers are not too loud but quality is good.....screen is okay..."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,For the delivery i got the product 2 days before the specified date and the amazon box was in ok condition .I think the packaging should be improved by amazon . Now for the LAPTOP so i have 512gb variant and First look - The design is good and feels smooth Booting time - this one is great just 7 seconds . Camera - Ok ok. dont expect much Keyboard - backlit is good and and overall keyboard is good Trackpad - ok trackpad but as it's gaming I think you should have mouse and keyboard seperately. Battery - This is the Worst part of this laptop I am sharing my usage SAVER MODE ON 80 percent goes to 90 min gaming 15 pecent goes to 23 min youtube BEST PERFORMANCE 80 percent goes to 60 min gaming 20 percent goes to 30 min youtube So in simple usage i get around 3 hours of usage. Charging time - this is fast too you can go to 0 to 100 in 2 hours and it just takes more time for 90 to 100 rest is very fast.. SO EXCEPT BATTERY THERE IS EVERYTHING AWESOME HERE.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Everything is fine awesome performance, gaming beast. One thing I request to seller please provide good packaging. Otherwise best in the market. HP product quality 100% genuine 🤗."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Awesome product, but supplied with 8 month lapse warranty. bought in feb 2021 but warranty already started from july 2020. Regarding warranty, No solution provided by Amazon. but thanks to Amazon the product was replaced with a new one."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I was looking for personal pc not for gaming and it's best configuration available at this price during prime day sale. Using since 1 month and working like charm for my daily use, office work."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"This review is after using the laptop for a month. PROs: 1. Its booting fast, 2. All big apps opening fast, 3. No lagging, 4. Refresh rates are fantastic, 5. RAM management is unbelievable. I can work with many big applications(VS, SQL, VS Code) parallelly without any disruptions. 6. Battery comes for 4 to 5 hrs.  CONs: The only CON I can say is the Camera, Its worst.  But still I am going for 5 stars because I bought this lap solely for coding, gaming and movies. They are fantastic."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,I got these two dots here I wonder what it is can someone help?!
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,After using one month..it started lines and black spot on the screen and even though HP 1yr warranty..they are not providing free service... saying that it is chargeable need to pay to avail warranty service. Worst experience I had ever in my life
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Writing this review after using it for using it for 10 months. This is a good performance laptop with nice graphics . The battery life is pretty poor i.e. we only get 2-2.5 hrs and with game just 1.5 hrs . The performance is really good as I could play cyberpunk in ultra settings without much lag. The hinges feel a bit unsteady but good. The keyboard is good. The camera is average with lot of grains and very wide. Heating is one issue I faced a lot but its adjustable. The charging is pretty fast and the SSD is good. I could even play nba 2k21 without any problems. The speakers quality is real good but the decibels is a bit less at times. It is a good buy in its segment and it does give the stability of hp. So my overall review is it best in its segment with really good performance and graphics.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Product is average but old stock sold by seller.only six months warranty given by HP and worst customer service of HP .avoid purchasing by this seller.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Check Warrenty & Serial number of the product first i got wrong product
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"It's a really fast laptop. Less than 8 sec booting up time. 60hz display is OK. 4GB graphics card along with 8GB RAM is enough for decent gaming. But I'm disappointed with the intel i5 9th gen processor, could have gone with AMD Ryzen chips instead. The only problem i faced is with the mouse pad. It's not good built and kinda clicky. Overall built quality is good. But it's heavy"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Not booting up after charging for 1 hour for the first time.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I had a problem while updating windows and it fails to start up. I contacted the seller and they quickly replaced it with a new one. Now, it is working smoothly."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Very nice purchase on amazon. Thanks. Seller shipped product, I warranty already started 6 month back. Amazon Pls provide extended warranty as it was amazon assured product."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Battery is very bad
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Don't buy it , it's not good for gaming because it's refresh rate is only 60hz which we only give you upto 60 fps in any games max 😭 , whether u have GTX or rtx on it ... Better go for something else please .... The battery is worse ,..."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Warranty is almost out as per HP record and Seller is not tracable, neither getting any help from Amazon buyer support."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,very good product with SSD but i feel 1TB HDD should be provided with this price range :68K. with ssd. fast and keyboard is also nice to type.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"It's very Good Lapi, I ordered 512ssd + 32optane, I Got 144Hz display which i was not expected. U Will Get only 477GB space a little compromising But we can add extra ssd also. Every thing is Perfect but u got 4 hours battery life and in gaming u get 2 to 2.30hr battery backup. U need to run Optane memory from windows search bar to Activate it."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I bought this for around 63000. Its really a nice laptop but only for gamers. Gaming experience is great. No lags. Battery life is average. (4 hours for normal usage 1.5hour for gaming) Its a bit bulky laptop, its not convenient to move it around. So if you want a nice gaming laptop then go for it and if you are not into gaming then go for something else.  I faced some hardware issues so i returned the laptop."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"After purchasing only I came to know that, NVIDIA graphics not performing as it configured in online. Speaker, camera connection issues are started."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Battery backup is the worst. It doesn't give backup for 2 hrs also.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,It could have been pre-loaded with ms-office student version and anti virus for at least 1 year.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I bought this lap for 60K during republic day sale..The lap looks so good... performance beast..but except the battery ..It drains fast even in new condition..so,better go for asus if u need battery life with same performance.."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Good for price- warranty given was only 9months and product registration date shwown was few months earlier than I purchased. So make an enquire before purchase. Performance is smooth- well it's new machine so can not conclude. Also, battery removal is tedious as we have to open up the backcover completely."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Delivered on time meeting the expectations of package and handling. Only thing that should have been as cons is Price should have been under 63k. If you are tight on budget then seems to be gr8 for gaming. Boots within 8-9 seconds. Intel Optane is doing a great job.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Good looking laptop which is very capable and portabl. Finish is rubberized so no minor scratches. Beautiful looking backlit keyboard.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Its a really good laptop.Starts up in 3 -5 seconds.Doesnt heat up. Good battery life.Go for it! (again its an electronic item so fingers crossed you get a good piece)
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Graphics Card is being bottlenecked due to a low number of cores in the processor. Thus instead of giving a constant 60 fps in high quality as it is supposed to, it runs at 45 fps at high quality which further drops during long hours of gaming."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Great but there is warranty mismatch hope they solve it, so please check after receiving it. Display is very good. battery backup for normal usage would be 4 1/2 hours."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"great purchase, just try to get this on discount and you're done ✅ great product"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"You can play games with higher quality and all, but there is a problem for ""gamers"" you will deffinetly recognize the screen isnt that good for gaming like 60hz is noticible but overall this machine is powerful and compact it is a beast at this price."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I have using this item for 4 months and so far it has been performing excellent, I use it for editing and it works well with premier pro. Not used for gaming so don't know about it but for editing it works really well and boot time is 4 sec which is amazing."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Really love it. One of the best gaming Laptop.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Very good deal. Laptop is sleek and looks good considering a gaming laptop. Performance and quality is top notch.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,The SSD makes it fast. A small thing that potential buyers should think - the keyboard is black and the background is also black so in slight dark it gets difficult to see the keys. Solution: You can turn the backlit on for the keyboard or you need to turn the room light on :)
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,This one is best till date at this price.... I named mine @BEAST....
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Value for money , can use not only for gaming but also for work purposes and it doesn't gets heated because of its dual fans. So impressed go for it."

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"EXCELLENT Performance.. Good battery...to make it better use Intel graphics for most of the things and Nvidia for games. Other than that no settings need to be changed, it is perfect."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Gaming purpose and work purposes it is an amazing laptop, there are few other options to go for at this price but this is also fairly good, it's a bit heavy but that is because it is a gaming laptop"

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"A beast for gaming , the gtx 1650 works charmingly , a decent battery life for a gaming laptop.

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,This is the best gaming/Office Work laptop out their at a 60k budget...As Always HP doesn't disappoint Their customers ✅🙏Dont Think Twice!! Go For It

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"There is a better option there in replacment for this this laptop with same price range 'Msi gl65 leopard 9SCSK which comes with i5-9300H, nvidia geforce gtx 1650 ti , 512gb nvme m.2 ssd and ips panel with 60 hz refresh rate . The main difference between msi and hp laptop is that msi gl65 leopard comes with grx 1650 ti but hp comes with only gtx 1650"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,It ticks all the boxes in terms of specification and configurability.
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It has been 1-2 years since i am using this laptop so i am writing the review after thoroughly using it. If you are getting this for occasional gaming usage and rest for working, think again. This thing weighs like a brick and the heat released from it directly goes to the lap. You can check the video, the sound that you hear is the fans of the laptop, and of course we can’t control the fan speed.  The laptop regularly keeps crashing after a year or so, and switches of abruptly when it comes around 15-20%. Its a mess to carry around, so if you’re considering this as a laptop, then its might be a bad decision as its nothing less of a PC for the weight and restrictions this carries.  Now coming to the MAIN ISSUE- The sleek design that you see, the sharp cut edges which connect the screen to the keyboard, is narrow, unlike other laptops. So it gives it a dashing look which attracts everyone. But, the this narrow connection from keyboard to screen puts a lot of load while opening and closing the laptop or using it while you’re on your bed etc. Due to this, at some point, a wire will break or short circuit and your display will start to freeze as shown in video. This has happened to me before as well, and i had to change the rolling mechanism wholly, and now i might have to do it again.  Trust me, even i want dont want to feel like i have made a bad investment, but I simply just couldn’t resist writing a transparent review 🙌🏻"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"I am giving this review after 1 month of usage. My profession requires me to make video calls for 10 hrs continuously. Basically I use heavy softwares and do video calls on my laptop without rest, still I found no heating issues. And also it never hanged or its performance was never slow. Secondly, the laptop is really very fast with only 3sec booting time. I haven't really faced any issues since 1month. Its an amazing laptop no doubt about it. Just go for it. Coming to the disadvantages, there are two. Though it does not affect me significantly. One, it has 60hz screen refresh rate. Second, the webcam is not really nice but it is not really horrible either."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The only problem laptop has is that the hinges are made cheap material , because of which the breakers after some , and in some cases you might not able the lid of the laptop."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Crap quality. Bought this from hp world in August. In just a week the f5 key came off. The keyboard is extra flimsy. As you can see in pics. Even took the extra three year warranty. Now for last three.months the sc say part is not available. Now they say there is no warranty for keyboard. Also asking for Rs.9000 for the keyboard. Such a flimsy stuff costing at the most maybe a Rs. 1000 on this very site lol. I do have an hp nx7400 which I am using since 2007. This laptop shows how bad hp has become. Better buy some other brand at this price.
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"The laptop seems good, but had problems with warranty (only 6 months was left) and that suggests that laptop was used or opened, so Amazon replaced it. The second replacement received had trackpad issues, and Amazon denied a replacement, so HP engineer came and checked and asked Amazon to replace it with a DOA order, and it seems Amazon does not understand what this means. Even after the DOA order by HP, Amazon agreed at first but later denied to replace, and the price had increased, plus was not getting free emi for 12 months. In the end Amazon agreed to give cashback but without any emi option. What a shame, wasted 15 days just with all the ruckus and misinformation shared by Amazon agents, these agents had limited knowledge, and no idea of matters outside their system."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"On paper this seems good, but the hardware and manufacturing quality is low, in my laptop, hinge broke lose from display panel housing so i couldnt close the laptop,as the tension is very tight, the screws are very tight on motherboard , i needed to install nvme, but i couldnt, as the screw wouldnt come out,so i just tapped it, plus the cooling is really bad, it may have good processing unit, but higher the processing power it will have higher will be the heat and you will end up buying a cooling pad, or you should replace thermal paste if you can do that sort of stuff, i tired doing that too,but screws of heat sink wont came out, infact i ended up wearing of the grove of that screw, so just in 2 years am getting frustrated with it. Also the battery replacement aint easy to find especially from amazon and flipkart, you have to go for websites with low trust factor, nut that goes fro Omen too as they have same battery as this ."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"Firstly ,Battery life is not good .. it's comes with 33% battery and within 2 mins it becomes 7% and then in 2 sec laptop locking .. secondly , there is no bill and no warranty card with this product delivery . If a person wants any repair of product within warranty period how can he/she will do that without a warranty card or bill ."
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"OK SO HERE ME OUT ON THIS.... THIS LAPTOP IS AN ABSOLUTE BEAST . FOR A USER LIKE ME 8GB RAM AND i5 9th GEN IS PERFECT AND MORE THAN ENOGH.... ABSOLUTELY NO LAG WHATSOEVER....  GREAT FOR GAMING AS WELL... I TRIED GTA 5 AND GOT 60FPS EASILY... ON HIGHEST RESOLUTION.  BATTERY LIFE IS HUGE AS COMPARED TO OTHER GAMING LAPTOPS. IT LASTS ME OVER 5 HOURS ON NORMAL USAGE LIKE WEB BROWSING ,STUDYING, WATCHING SOME VIDEOS ETC.... I HAVENT TRIED GAMING WITHOUT CHARGING AS THERE IS NO POINT OF THAT...  NOW SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS LAPTOP OVERHEATS WHILE GAMING WHICH COULD BE TRUE FOR LONG RUN. BUT THERE IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THAT. TRY THROTTLE STOP !!!! FOR ME IT WORKED LIKE A BOON.  NOW I PLAY GTA 5 WITH CONSTANT 60FPS AND HIGHEST RESOLUTION UNDER 60DEGREE... WHICH IS AMAZING!!!!!  THE SCREEN IS THE BEST, THE VEIWING ANGLES ARE GREAT AND ANTIGLARE SAVED MY NERDY ASS.  HP TAKES SOME EXTRA MONEY BUT FOR THEIR GEAT SERVICE AND LONG LASTING LIFE OF DEVICES I THINK ITS WORTH IT.  AND DID I TALK ABOUT THE SOUND QUALITY? ITS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I WAS QUITE SHOCKED TO HEAR THE CRISP SOUND THAT WAS LOUD ENOUGH THAT MY WHOLE HOUSE COULD HEAR IT WITH CLARITY.  BACKLIT IS LIT!!  WEBCAM IS AVERAGE THO..."

HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"The laptop has amazing speed as expected. Boots in 3sec or less. Gaming is smooth, most games can be played at medium to high rendering but not ultra.  Cons 1. Keyboard is backlit but the keys are barely visible due to less black and purple contrast. This makes it pretty much impossible to use it. So it's not for someone using it for programming even though it has good performance."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"This laptop is awesome only con is that battery and it have some heating effect , heating effect can be managed by having a cooling fan so overall it’s really an 🔥🔥"
HP-Pavilion-Processor-15-6-inch-15-dk1148TX,laptop,"As great as it may seem, the design is the poorest of choice. The way screen is connected to the main body puts a lot of pressure on the screen hindges. these hindges breaks off quite easily. Plus the repair cost of these hindges comes around 12000. This is so absurd. The looks of the laptop is really great but as looks are only skin deep."

ASUS-Vivobook-M712UA-AU521TS-Transparent-International,laptop,Laptop is working excellent without any issues. 16GB RAM does help to run smoothly. I like the backlit keyboard. I purchased 17.3 inch for my work which involves lot of reading documents and I love the screen size. Good for watching movies also. Overall satisfied with the laptop.
ASUS-Vivobook-M712UA-AU521TS-Transparent-International,laptop,"Pros, Massive display screen Fast booting All softwares and drivers are built-in (so no setup effort) 16GB ram with 6 core make it apt for heavy duty usage Sound volume and quality is impressive Geniune Windows 10 with pre-installed microsoft office Comes with keyboard backlight Mic placed near camera for clear sound quality during meetings No heating issues  Cons, Average camera 5G band signal range is less Keyboard finishing could be a bit better"
ASUS-Vivobook-M712UA-AU521TS-Transparent-International,laptop,"First of all very disappointed with amazon packaging and delivery. Buying a costly product it is expected to come in well protected packaging but the laptop came with just a poor quality cardboard box without any bubble wrap. The outer amazon box was crumbled and there were some small dents on laptop box. Thankfully the laptop was unharmed.  Now getting to the laptop here are the points I summarized after a week of usage:-  1 Awesome display with a huge 17"" high quality panel. Watching videos is very immersive experience.  2 The speakers are also adequately loud.  3 Keyboard quality is also good with blue backlight.  4 No lags faced. Everything is snappy. Ryzen 5 handles day to day tasks smoothly.  5 Even thought its a 17"" model it is surprisingly compact. For reference it is about 4cm more in length than average 15.6"" laptops.  6 Great battery life. I got around 9 hours with backlight off and power saving mode on while playing videos. While around 7 hours downloading and running heavy software.  7 Speaking of games it can play GTA 5 at high and normal settings at 30fps but i wouldn't recommend playing heavy games as temperatures rose upto 96 degrees. Its a notebook laptop so I didn't expect much gaming performance. It can play Valorant at 120fps on low settings.  8 Trackpad gestures also work flawlessly.  9 Decent webcam  Con :-  Only con I noticed is right side of laptop gets a bit warm as only one fan is placed on the left side.  I was facing issue that I couldn't adjust the brightness at the beginning. This was resolved after updating the windows.  This is the best and most affordable 17"" laptop in this price range. I got it for 63,500 Rs. If you are not into heavy gaming just go for it."
ASUS-Vivobook-M712UA-AU521TS-Transparent-International,laptop,"My prevoius AMD laptop takes about 25 minutes to compile and build the codes in Android Studio. This one took only 22 seconds.  For rebuilding the project, previous laptop takes about 5 minutes. But this one just took 7 seconds.  Rygen 5 is a super fast processor. You won't get disappointed. Just go for it. Its a value for money laptop.  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
ASUS-Vivobook-M712UA-AU521TS-Transparent-International,laptop,Amazing product. Just received it yesterday. Will add complete review after using it for few days.  Battery life : 11hours (Surfing and watching YouTube videos)
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,1. Great performance on heavy audio editing software. 2. superb upgrading capability with both SSD & HDD. 3. free SATA cable inside the box. 4. Battery performance is ok.

I got this laptop under 62k and I love this laptop, it's jst amazing, solid bulid quality, looks simply sexy, very smooth as well as fast and it's 144hz screen was cherry on cake but it feels quite heavy otherwise it's an amazing laptop. If ur budget is approx 60k then close ur eyes and buy this without any doubt......."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"For gaming goood, battery life aint so sustainable overall good deal"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"OverPowered Specs for the price! The laptop comes with pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with all essential apps like Word, PPT, ect. TUF metal and plastic Build! The coolers keep the laptop very cool. RGB is very good and even the brightness of the rgb keyboard is adjustible! The camera is decent. i5 10300H with GTX 1650 is a good combo for gaming and you can get upto 120fps for Valorant. The 144hz fhd display is Killer! Go for it!"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"My laptop arrived in great condition but just after 2 days of normal usage it suddenly died and did not turn on at all. I plugged in the charger and jt showed no indication of charging or anything. Pretty sure he sent me a defective product that might've been returned by several people before.  So when it died the whole return and refund process was nothing but a huge waste of time. Firstly I had no other option than exchange so as I requested an exchange I received a call from amazon customer support for fixing the problem but nothing worked so now I was waiting for exchange. Now the delivery guys with the new laptop arrived to pick up the defective one and give me the new one but since the laptop wouldn't turn on they were unable to provide the exchange and Now I have to talk to the customer service and ask them to file a refund. So now I wait another 4 days and they finally took it away and I got my mlmey back. Such a huge waste of time  My experience with the laptop for those 2 short days where good, its a great laptop runs everything with ease. 144hz screen is great is amazing but still I'd recommend not buying online.  Amazon is pretty reliable and never does wrong to the customer so props to the great customer service."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,got this latop for 63990rs in amazon sale. just started using it and i am loving it. lets hope i dont face any problems if any happens i'll update here also.  The settings for gaming are very diffiult to understand !
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"I got this laptop for 62k, for that it has a good spec to price ratio. I won't call it a bang for the buck but the price is pretty good. Pros- 1) its has an 144hz display which is an eyecandy, and no other laptop offers such display in this price range. For a normal user the display is crisp and punchy. 2)performance is top notch for 1080p gaming i get 144fps constant while plugged in valorant (this is the only videogame i play.) 3) battery is above average i got around 3-4 hrs of screen onn time with normal use and 1.5-2 hrs wits gaming depending on graphical settings. I recommend to play games while plugged in. 4) boot time is really fast. Laptop boots within 6 secs most of the time. Thanks to ssd. 5)The design of this laptop is really catchy but at the same time it doesn't scream gaming. To be precise its balanced design. 6) There are all the ports you will need on the laptop. 7)The rgb keyboard cherry on the cake. This is also not present in any laptop in this price range. 8)the my asus feature on this laptop is really convinient to wirelessly transfer files from phone to laptop. And its really fast.  Cons- 1) Due to rgb keyboard and 144hz display the storage option on this perticular model is 512gb and for higher storage option u have to go for the more expensive varient. 2)The storage here is 512gb but after all the windows installation and bloatware from both asus and microsoft we are left wits around 418gb which may seem a lot but isn't enough for a power user like me. 3)Asus's armoury crate in this laptop is pretty much useless as there aren't many customisation options available.there are only performance customisation which i think also customise the fan speed and rgb customisation which include only 4 options as its one zone rgb keyboard. 4) camera on this laptop is straight up trash though it claims to be 720p but the video is really grainy even in good light. 5)this may be nitpicking but asus claim this laptop to be military grade durable and i doubt that as there is flex in deck as well as screen."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,The Paking Box of the laptop was damaged I don't know how a strong box like this can be damaged. I was very disappointed seeing that . Amazon should atleast check the items box before delivery.
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Using it purchased on 27/7/2021 and will update pros and cons
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Got this awesome laptop today. Took 10 days for amazon to deliver this order, but that might be due to the covid situation. The laptop is a bit heavy, but thin. The ""grey"" color on the top is actually darker than what's seen in the pic. The screen is fabulous. Tried valorant in it today and it was okay. Gave 160fps in medium settings. There's no MS subscription but there's a one month xbox game pass.The boot up time is around 3-4 secs. i5 10th gen with 1650 is good, although 1650Ti or 1660Ti would've been better. But I suppose they can't sell laptops with such GPUs for 62k. The backlit keyboard is awesome too.The battery is okay."

Update 02: Everything is perfect, loved this laptop. Just one thing about the display again, these displays don't feel robust. I would go for HP over this one.

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Laptop is good and perfect..... I thought at the laptop is screen ... Then I got replacement also but the reality.. On battery power by default the laptop set to 60hz when ever you Plug in it changes from 60 to 144hz and when u plug out 144 to 60hz so this is why it 2 sec time screen gets off and on..... No issue in it.... If you want to get rid it means right click on desktop and got display settings and goto advance system setting change 60 to 144hz then your laptop will 144hz during on battery power also then screen will not off...  *Performance - 5/5 *Display- 5/5 *Battery- 4/5 on normal usage 3-4 hours easily we are getting

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Best in 61000₹ There are many hidden features like asus armoury creat for control rgb keyboard and fan speed My asus app asus link for may purpose like to share data from PC to phone and phone to PC and use your phone camera as web cam also you can control fan speed ram cleaning from phone also you can receive or send phone calls from laptop  Negative points Battery Is avarage for normal use not bad not good  Whenever charge laptop or plugged out screen is blink one time.....it’s not bug it’s asus feature but I don’t like it....  All over there is nothing best beyond this in this price....!!

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I am using this laptop from last 1 month and this is awsome laptop. No thermal issue if you are playing game I played valorent , Gta 5 , Apex legends etc. So I didn't feel any thermal issue. Only one drwaback that is it's battery life but we didn't expect battery with gaming laptops so it's the only issue else when you plug in it to charger it's screen got off for few seconds and when you remove charger again it's screen going off for few seconds , First I think it's a detactive after that I call service center they told that when you plug it to charger then it's display using 144 Hz and when you remove charger it's screen using 60 Hz that's the reason of that, you can resolve this problem by going to display setting > Advanced settings > and their a option 60/144Hz. But 144 Hz consume more battery ."

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,It's a fine laptop but the problem I got whenever it switch from battery power to AC ( or try to charge the battery) there is flicker in screen Ethernet connection is good but wifi is not as good as ethernet if you connect to a wifi router after sometime connection will terminate automatically Speed is good but not as good it advertising may because of less cache memory If you play game only then battery is bellow average for multitasking it is good.

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"I didn't use this for a long time but I'll write a review anyway. Display- The display is good. The viewing angles are great and the brightness is sufficient indoors. The colour accuracy mentioned in the description may not be great but it doesn't make any difference in day to day tasks. The 144Hz display is excellent and has made the UI very snappy and the difference is noticeable. Battery- It's a gaming laptop, so as expected 3-3.5 hours for normal tasks.  Build Quality- Excellent. The aluminium lid makes the screen sturdy and the body also looks fine Design- Although subjective, this design is one of the best. It isn't too flashy and the looks elegant when viewed from the top. Keyboard- Due to the number pad, it is slightly crammed but the typing experience is great nevertheless. Extensive RGB lighting is there. Touch pad- it's ok. It's not glass so I don't expect Macbook level smoothness. SSD- Very fast boot speed. Performance- The performance is excellent. I didn't see any heating issues. Weight- Yes it's 2.3kgs but it's manageable. However, it is quite thick. Overall for the price this is more than expected."

Laptop is freaking damn solid, Sturdy, light weight  With windows 10 everything is working nice. SSD remains true to its nature. Keyboard is just awesome, the AURA RBG makes it even insane. Used it in dark. Works good with back-lights. Eye light sensitivity is incredible, doesn't harm eyes if you look at keyboard under RGB effect for couple of minutes.  But the battery.... i don't know, this being my 1st laptop buy, I recharged it fully while doing windows setup, then let it drain entirely while setting up windows stuff and the recharged it again. Feels like it drains fast. Again I haven't played any games yet. So for now haven't put it under stress. So I am not rating any star for gaming.  I will do hardcore test, Will definitely give more review in coming days regarding gaming and battery.  For the time being Overall product is a Good Buy."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Writing this after using the lap for 3 weeks, Performance Beast at this price range  Pros : 144Hz Screen is a killer SSD 512GB and 8GB Ram Processor is very good RGB Keyboard is a big attraction Games like gta 5 fifa 21 can be played at ultra settings More than 75 fps  Cons: Battery Backup is only 2-3 hrs playing fifa 21, Gta 5 but it's okay since it is a gaming laptop  Gta 5 is hanging when the charger is not plugged in but when we plug the charger we can get 75-90fps in ultra settings"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"It is an absolute value for money, best for gaming in budget, and for using CAD and other designing softwares. Excellent Screen Resolution for Movies and Games. Only hiccup I have is that it should have come with Office 365 free for a year as how it comes with other laptops which are less than its price range. ASUS should look into that as it is mianly used by students so MS Office is a critical feature for the students. For gaming, i would suggest 60hz for such games which don't require too much usage, but for heavy games such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and many newer games switching to 144hz with laptop charging on will give you best performance."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"This is the best in this price range. Playing Mafia definitive edition smoothly in high settings. Absolute beast, can't explain it in other words. I am really happy about it. Sound is very good when compared with other lappys. Been using this for about a week."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"What could I say more, it's awesome laptop, excellent performance for gaming, heavy coding and for other video related editing works, got this around 62k, good colorization and everything's great, screen is awesome no worries such as screen bleeding."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Probably the best laptop that you can get from Asus for this price range (Around 62k when I got it). Great entry/mid level gaming laptop, excellent build quality and ergonomics, of course don't be expecting great battery life on this but it can hold up to about 3-4 hours easily (not while gaming though), It can pretty much run any AAA titles on medium at 1080p 60fps (Can crank up some older games to high/ultra) with no lag whatsoever and that 144hz refresh panel while playing FPS games like Doom or CSGO is so satisfying! Overall a great portable gaming station...."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,A pack of awesome-ness from asus. Its made in china. But performance and looks are great. Got it under 62K best perfomance under this price range.

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"The delivery was on time, after 2 days of use. I can say that Pros: 144 hz display 1650 is neat RGB is a nice touch SSD boot times are good I couldn’t get any good games to benchmark but it gave around 60fps on max on Genshin since it’s capped on 60 FPS. Armoury crate  Cons : i5 is eh The battery life is mediocre The temps go up to 90c sometimes it’s usually around 75-85 so it’s not half bad The camera is average"

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11 The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source. I recommend this laptop to everyone who really wants to achieve something in their life and hidden features like MYAsus are add on for this laptop. I liked the RGB keyboard and the stickers provided in the box.

Laptop is awesome 😎, sleaky design attracts everyone and the sharp edges makes it much more pretty and brush finish at keyboard and all over the body makes it look rich. 1.everyone is says that it has thermal issue.but listen to me it has no thermal issue if you are a normal user like watching movie, playing music and browsing u will face no thermal issue. 2.If you are a pro gamer go for rog why tuf. it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k 3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting 4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only 5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point 6.just go for it"

We can add more storage (1 M.2 + 1 SATA 2.5"" HDD/SSD empty Slot) and RAM (upto 32GB) that means we don't need to buy a new laptop we can simply upgrade this machine as per our requirement.  *Currently using since past 7 days & I will post a detailed review in couple of months"

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"I bought this laptop for my son the device functioned smoothly for a day however, on second day the power went off without any warning and the laptop is dead since. The Amazon people arranged replacement however due to device not starting replacement was denied and cancellation of order was suggested, which has been done. The point is when customers is buying such a costly product quality should be ensured otherwise it is pointless to buy online where there is so much fuss to get replacement."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"I have had 2 Asus laptops and both of them had severe manufacturing and quality control issues. However this one which i ordered from asus website deserves a special mention: 1. Extremely Poor Battery (1.5 Hrs when surfing internet even at 60hz mode) 2. Poor build ( Hinges and frame making noice that too in 6 months ) 3. Poor Processor ( Don't be fooled, it's a 10th gen processor which is no match to current Ryzen or Intel Chips ) 4. Frequent Wifi Disconnections ( Possibly Poor quality Wifi Card ) 5. Poor Quality Trackpad ( Even China will be ashamed, it's that poor quality ) 6. Mediocre Keyboard ( Average at Best, forget it being good for coding or other keyboard intensive tasks ) 7. Overheating ( Even Intel would be ashamed, idk if my Ryzen chip is faulty or what ) 8. Pathetic Customer Service ( Insisting me to get this junk 'repaired' even when the whole laptop should be replaced. They are the only ones who say they can only replace within first 7 days after which they can only repair no matter what) 9. Mediocre at Best Screeen ( It's Full HD but you will find it lacking , moreover viewing angles are as bad as they can get ) 10. USB ports poor too ( Too loose, expect keyboard and joystick to keep disconnecting repeatedly )  So, beware and look for good brands such as Dell or Acer even if they cost slightly more. Atleast they don't use 3rd quality parts"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"The specs are good but faced many problems with the laptop. Had wifi disconnection problems, the display goes out, and many others. Their service center is the worst of all. First, they respond like after a week if at all they do. Sometimes they have not raised a complaint yet even after you raised like multiple times and no qualified technicians and they are very rude. You will feel regret as to why you bought their product.  Stay clear of ASUS products in India and save yourself from Headaches."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"First of all, I love Asus because they never disappointed me. This particular laptop at 62K is a bargain IPS display at 144hz is a gangster, blacks are awesome, Call of Duty Warzone is amazing, although RTX will be even better but you cannot expect RTX at this price, I don't think there is a better laptop than this in Amazon India right now with with i5 chip at this price either gaming or non-gaming. This is also blazing fast in browsing and heat dissipation is engineered to perfection. Overall a great buy. Upgrading memory and disk size is a piece of cake as Asus already provided extra slots for both, once again thanks to Asus for making Amazing machines. Amazon delivered it earlier than promised despite pandemic lockdowns."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Best Display :-Fhd at 144hz is just a eye candy..Anti glare coating does not strain the eyes neither gives headache...its super smooth cuz of 144hz..but not for video editing or content creation because of its 45% ntsc color panel, AUDIO:- Speakers are just awesome...No Regret...Additinally Asus gives so many audio features so its just dope...u can definately feel the audio coming from 360° BATTERY:-Charges in an hour ...and lasts for 6-7 hrs on normal usage in silent mode on performance mode battery backup drops to about 3 hrs which is normal. HARDWARE:- Fortress Grey looks so LIT AND FASCINATING..upper lid has aluminium covering and is durable but the whole body is made of abs plastic and can withstand drops from 4-5ft ..Moreover this laptop has military grade 810H certification ...so no complaints about hardware,i5 10th gen can handle most tasks without breaking sweat there r no lags or stuttering or anything moreover its a smooth experience SOFTWARE:-WINDOWS 10 + ASUS APPS, ARMOURY CRATE... WHAT ELSE CAN SOMEONE WANT. SUPER SATISFIED with this ASUS LAPTOP"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"I OURCHASED THIS LAPTOP RECENTLY. I AM VERY HAPPY WTH MY PRODUCT. ASUS HAS NEVER MADE ME DOWN. THE PERFORANCE IT PROVIDES IS JUST OUTSTANDING AND WITH THE GTX 1650, IT BLOWS EVERYTHING AWAY. 8 GB RAM IS ENOUGH WHICH CAN BE UPGRADED TO A MAX OF 32GB RAM AS PER REQUIREMENTS. SSD IS ALSO VERY FAST. MY SYSTEM BOOTS UP IN LESS THAN 3.9 SEC. VERY VERY HAPPY BUYING THIS PRODUCT AND RECOMMEND YOU ALSO TO DO THE SAME. GOOD LAPTOP FOR GAMERS AS WELL AS PROGRAMMERS."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is the best laptop with the price range i can say, for gaming its perfect with 144hz refresh rate can get max 120fps with lowest settings and with high arround 70-80fps which is actually very good. Then battery is also okok as its a gaming laptop so u cant expect more.. but yes its fine. Its value for money under 61k with 144hz which no other brand provide. People who used hdd for long long time they will be happy like me, literally 3-4secs to boot- damnnn u will love it.  U can absolutely go for this, no doubt, i have tested games like Apex legends with low setttings give me around 130-135fps. And engineering softwares like autodesk, cad, ansys all are working smooth. But the 512gb ssd varirant and add 1more 500gb, that will be sufficient. At last buy it for perfect deal, i have got for 51k due to my old laptop exchange so its worth it.👍👍🙂🙂"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Screen bleeding started just after 10 days and then when i went to service center they told me to wait for 1 month, so keep in mind about these things before buying it Horrible service by Asus Maybe i think its not a original product"

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"There's a display issue on the laptop, don't buy it from amazon Don't trust amazon for expensive things, disgusting services"
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  For the price, I think the performance is justified. I5 10300H is not that bad as people say it to be if you main purpose is playing games. But if you want to do workstation loads I would suggest Ryzen. Performance: The only game I played till now is Warzone. The game has become demanding I would say that much. If you are in some open area like farm fields you'll get around 65-72fps but if you are in lets say downtown you'll get around 57-65fps. Upgrade it 16gb for better performance. Now mine is 1650ti, if you go for 1650 expect some 6-10fps less. Thermals: This is the area I see people complain about most in TUF laptops. Again its not that bad as people complain it to be. I turn on my AC and the temps doesn't cross 88°C which is normal for a gaming laptop. Display: Smooth 144hz no complains there. Color accuracy, well - its decent. Like I mentioned before if you only want to game the colors are good. You can message me on instagram if you got anything else to ask. Its dannyy___18 but dont ask me to run workstation programs."
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Worth your money. I intended to purchase for my design purpose (SolidWorks / Lumion 11 / Fusion360. etc) which I was unable to run on my i3 sys. It's working very smooth now on this machine.  You might experience heating up and battery drainage which can be expected in this laptop depending on your application of use.
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,I have bought this laptop on 8th july this year and after 10 days the left speaker is producing crackling sound whenever i play some sought of sound......i cant carry on my study and other stuffs....😤

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,It's a bad choice to purchase anything from asus. No product last for more then a year. I am saying with my personal experience
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,It's not worth spending money on this brand. I have notice mostly motherboards and inbuilt keyboards starts giving problem after some time. And worse is the after sales support
ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,It's really very good laptop @63990 with GTX1650ti GPU with 120htz refresh rate..  Also build quality is the best 👍

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,Just go for it ! Best gaming laptop... U will get 60 + fps for high end games ! Dont expect much from the battery tho - its normal its a gaming laptop ... Display is wonderful and the performance is mind blowing !

ASUS-i5-10300H-Graphics-Fortress-FX566LH-HN257T,laptop,"Never buy it. I bought this product 1 year 3 months ago. First, the WiFi died shortly after the warranty period ended. I am using another USB WiFi adapter. Now a few days ago the charger died and I searched all the online shops in India but could not find it. I called the support of Asus they informed me that the laptop is Chinese. So there is no opportunity to buy a charger in India. How cruel is Asus?."

Update Games running smoothly with good graphics and colour accuracy, no problem at all in daily tasks."
Lenovo-82C7A006IH-Windows-10-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Overall good product. You can go for it.
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"As far as i used i think this laptop is fine,  •Build quality is good but hinges are little weak so display wobbles •Display is good and is quite big and i like it Edit 1 I checked my display model using Hwinfo and found out that it has 6 bit china made chi mei display, but Good 8 bit display for boe display for other victus variant  Not a good move Hp •Speakers are also good •Trackpad is good •Laptop keyboard is excellent •Value for money as you are getting newer cpu and sufficient amount gpu performance  Edit 1:Hp has wantedly capped 5600h to 30w to avoid higher temps which performs just like 4600H . So if you are thinking to buy this laptop dont buy this as it has more cons than pros.Even IdeaPad with 4600h gives same performance  Buy IdeaPad 3 gaming or legion 5 or acer nitro 5 instead of this laptop  You will praise me for neglecting this laptop and buying a better value laptop"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"It's a good gamming laptop (normal gamming) things i love in this laptop is its battery life,thermals,ms office life time validity and it comes with a decent looks. if you're student and search for good gamming and normal use it is the best but if you want only a gamming laptop then go to hp pavilion 15-ec2004AX model in flipkart it comes with same specifications and includes refresh rate of 144hz in 64k price"

HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,Laptop looks ok. Charger is looks like power bank. Heated soon after 15 mints
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"Wobbling effect is very prominent and no doubt in that. Just switch on your fan and you can see it clearly. If still you can't notice it, then start your webcam and see the earthquake on your screen. Apart from this everything else is very nice. Amazon offer 14% off, Exchanged my 10 years old asus laptop for 12k, coupon discount 2k, some more discount with credit card.... Got it @Rs. 51,740. Thanks to Amazon for excellent service and offer. Delivery received on 10.08.2021. Finally, you may ignore the wobble effect for this configuration at this budget. Even though the screen will be having wobble effect but it's not affecting while doing any work on laptop. Opening the lid a bit extra reduces the wobble effect to a great extent. If getting the lappy on a good offer price, then go for it."

Pro's :  1) Most of the features are excellent. 2) Battery life is excellent. 3) Design and body finishing is highly impressive. 4) Heat sink fans are excellent. 5) Touch pad is really smooth.  Con's :  (Blocker issues)  1) The wifi gets disconnected automatically, and it wont show any of the networks untill we troubleshoot the problem or restart the PC. Please check the video section for the wifi problem (Observed this 7-8 times daily, not sure where the issue exists). Day by day the wifi is disconnecting more number of times, what if it doesnot work after 1 month.  2) The charger / adapter should be of 200w, but i have received 150w charger. Even the HP customer support person confirmed , the adapter should be of 200w. (Major problem) 3) The charger / adapter, heats up while we are charging the laptop, it gets heated up to such a extent that, we cant touch it by the laptop gets charged fully.  (Major problems)  3) The screen wobbles a bit. (While travelling it may be major concern) 5) It has only 3 USB slots. 6) The SSD is of 512 GB (I feel which is less, they can increase some more price and give minimum 1tb) 7) No shortcut key for wifi/bluetooth."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,Pros- 1)Pricing was good for these specs. 2)Many use full app pre installed. 3)Good upgradation level with 2 ssd slot and 2 ram slot. 4)Simple and classic design and look. 5)keyboard fell good and trackpad is also very responsive. cons- 1)Build quality is not strong and durable for travelling. 2)Ventilation and cooling is not good. Playing games and quickly they temperature of cpu reaches from 50 to 90 degree Celsius with in 30 minutes. 3)Not good performance when unplugged from the charger .They performance drop is dramatic. Playing games like control and fortnight and they fps reaches 1/4 .Control at medium settings reaches from 45 to 12 fps and fortnight from 75 to 30 fps and bellow.
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"- Built like a tank - Light wobble (even 13 inch laptops wobble), but even the Macbook Pro wobbles - Excellent crisp sound by Bang and Olufsen - Super fast performance - MS Office pre-installed - Efficient cooling system - Excellent matt finish, lesser chance of scratches - Beautiful display, plays 8k videos like a boss - Has all the ports one needs - Upgradable to Windows 11"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"Screen wobbles like anything if you switch on the fan . Hp shud note that not everyone in india use centralaised ac without ceiling fan . i think the loosened the screen hinge so that u can open/ lift the screen without applying pressure or holding the keybord , and they have ended up creating a very loose screen which wobbles like anything . has anyone found a solution to this"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,Good laptop overall but for a gaming laptop with such high specs refresh rate of 60 Hz makes no sense and to not list that in the specs is very unprofessional. Did not expect this from HP. Please update your specs to provide this information to your customers
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"The screen wobble is not noticeable while typing/using the laptop. I could only notice it if I intentionally flick the screen.  The display quality is great, battery life is great, performance is amazing.  The laptop doesn't look too big compared to 15.6 inch laptops.  Great battery life for a gaming laptop.  The keyboard is satisfying to type on, and the touchpad is quite big and responds well.  The surface of the laptop is prone to fingerprint marks.  Cooling is done well as temperature goes down in seconds once we stop heavy usage.  Webcam is average quality.  Probably the best laptop available in this price right now."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"For gamers- 1. Did all the stress test and the fans were working perfectly, they get loud sometimes but not a big deal. 2. Thermals are okish, personally did not faced any over heating, but could've been better. 3. Screen is the best part, it's big, colour rich and good viewing angles. 4. Wobble is there, under fan it wobbles, but not a major issue can ignore it, should not be a deal breaker for anyone, hinge passes the one hand open test. For gaming overall good.  For non gamers or casual gamers 1. Do not buy, you may be enticed by its processor and big battery, which lives upto their expectations. 2. Everyday task are handled like a pro, multiple tabs on brave browser were working without any lags. 3. Windows crashed few times but it's on windows really. 4. The main reason I do not recommend is wifi receptivity. It's really poor, the realtek wifi card is shit, if you are a normal user or a professional one looking for light gaming now and then, this weak wifi will disappoint you. 5. If you can live with wifi issue( which is stupid because then might as well buy a desktop) go for it, please check the warranty."

HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0075AX,laptop,"It's too expensive considering its built quality and wobbling, It should be priced around 1 lakh or extended warranty should be given free with it, It also has poor quality hinge, Hp should have provided more colour options."

Yes it has a wobble issue ,it wobbles a bit under full speed fan if your laptop is opened at 90° _! but if you adjust it about 110°_/ It won't wobble....the main highlights are 1.

Very delicate, battery is very weak, the on off button automatically gets started without doing anything, system is very slow and hangs up. It was mentioned during the time of order that preloaded Operating systems will be there but unfortunately I had to buy it at the cost of Rs. 4000 as it was laoded on trial basis and kept asking for renewal. Totally it is therefore absolutely crap at 30K. Request friend don't buy such third grade products. Even I am reluctant to buy such type of products online. It is better we buy in person."

Lenovo-82C7A006IH-Windows-10-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind."
Lenovo-82C7A006IH-Windows-10-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,"Good Product for Routine works like accounting, surfing, online application, online study, good looks, overall a value for money product."

The laptop is absolutely good, no problem there.. but they have put the price so high that nobody bought it until now 🤭. Please lenovo bring stocks and reduce the price.. and launch 5600h varients too"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,First of all it's not lenovo laptop slim 3i but it's lenovo laptop slim 3 so it's a mistake. Otherwise product is good. It's been a couple of weeks I received this laptop and enjoying it. 512 gb ssd puts extra power on performance and 8gb RAM is also supportive for performance and faster response.  One should buy it for performance. Here are some goods about this product:  Pros: 1. Lid can be opened up to 180 degree. 2. Fingerprint lock. 3. Privacy shutter on webcam. 4. Good build quality. 5. Performance is good.  Cons: 1. Backlit keyboard is not there. 2. Dvd/cd reader is not there. 3. No VGA/HDMI port.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Everything is good except the battery life. If you are working with the videos, the battery drains very quickly and the life reduces to hardly 2- 2.5 hours."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Over all product seem to be good👍 Body of laptop is sturdy . but it comes without back lit keyboard, and one month trail antivirus , battery back up is 2:00 to 2:30 hrs only."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Ordered this laptop in Freedom sale . Delivered in 2 days . When tried switching on, it is not starting ,but charging is working just fine. Ordered a replacement and they again delivered a faulty laptop with the same issue. The guy who came for returning is now saying that since it's not working we can't accept the return . Totally disappointed ☹️"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Best laptop for WFH use. Best keyboard,display is good, Microsoft Office 2019 provided, BACKLIGHT KEYBOARDS IS ALSO THEIR FOR 60K MODEL. Charging is fast, takes 1.5 hour to full charge. And battery back up is upto 4-5 hours.Boots up in seconds."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,Awesome.. extremely good for home usuages.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"I have been using this Product for 2 weeks. The Pros & Cons are following: Pros: 1. System speed is very fast, as 7.75 gb is usable RAM. 2. Slim fit & good outlook as well. Cons: 1. Battery drains too fast, battery power not really good. 2. Adapter size is too short, this creates problem while charging from a socket which is little bit away. Apart from the upper points, also check the warranty window after buying it, as for my case, I have to mail to Lenovo for updating my Warranty details (It was not updated properly)."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Found this laptop to be v sleek, overall. Like the keyboard (find the keys to be softer than most other laptop keyboards; more 'pleasant'? for typing, relatively speaking, though not quite as pleasant as it is w a MacBookPro). Like the way the touchpad has been positioned slightly to the left. Also like the fingerprint sensor doubling up as the power on/off button. Front-facing cam quality also relatively good, along with wide coverage of (user) background.  Would have preferred more RAM along with the whole pkg. Would have preferred more SSD storage space for this budget.  Budget-wise, feel this is priced up by about 20%, and I think that it will sell more units if Lenovo brings it down accordingly.  Overall, defn a good buy, and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants this config of laptop for their business/home purposes."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Amazon mentioned the laptop has pre-installed MS Office Home and Student 2019. But no such MS Office is there. When I start my laptop, it is asking me to buy Microsoft 365 personal.  Plz help..."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"It's an awesome product. Very much helpful for work from home. It doesn't heat at all. It has features like Mac Book. Slim product, looks good. System doesn't hang at all. I am writing this review after one month of using."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Sleek And Good Build Quality Fast, Precise and Sharp Great Display [You can tweak the color balance Using Color Calibration Settings in Windows] Battery Backup is well tuned depending on the usage. If you just require Word Processing, Browsing and reading pdfs then it can easily last for more than 6 hours and upto 8 Hours  Got it for 47000 after exchange and Discount Final Verdict : Amongst the best in segment. Can easily beat HP in looks and Design. One exceptional product from Lenovo"

Would recommend to anyone who just wants to browse or attend online programs. No Ethernet port is a bummer. Also, could have added one more USB type A port on the right side."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Lenovo ideapad series are midrange laptops which are suitable for pretty much everyone. You can watch movies, play most games at reduced graphics settings, read ebooks for long, video and photo editing. It doesn't come with a dedicated graphics card, so if you are looking something for AutoCAD, don't go for it.  Excellent Laptop. Great Finish and built quality. Boots in seconds. Screen resolution is very good and great viewing angles with awesome silver colour. If you want something from HP, please see one similar laptop from HP here .. it costs whooping 59k and this Lenovo laptop is price at 49k. So thumps up to Lenovo.  Pros: 1)The build of laptop is excellent with premium built quality. It feels very slim and light weight on daily usage. 2) Booting speed is great (2-3 second) and SSD works very fast. 3) The keyboard is a decent one for a laptop . 4) Touchpad is awsome and responsive with windows 10 gestures. Fingerprint is pretty good at its job. 5) Display quality is very good at this price range. Even at bright sunlight you can view the display effectively. 6) Batter backup is 5 - 6 hours at average usage. 7) Speaker are awesome and webcam is average but its better than expected.  Cons: 1) Sound is too crispy for my liking but most won't notice it. 2) Design is not that attractive.  No heating issue observed while normal browsing or typing. Touchpad is very responsive and all gestures are working really fine. Buttons seems a bit clicky . Let's see how long it lasts."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"Goood worth for money. You can buy it, or is so cool and it's delivery is so safe no need to worry"

Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Warranty-82H700KTIN,laptop,"There is nothing in it that I can give dislike about..... within 15 sec, it restart while others laptop taking 1-2 min. Speaker is quite good what expected....camera is just okay. You will have to use flat stiff board below the laptop to maintain air flow....as you can't use it resting it over bed as it bloked fans openings. But there should be user guide for some of new features which are unknown for a new buyer."

Went through all the laptops and later I bought this and also they are giving free gaming mouse. My opinion is this is just awesome and litt.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Graphics-81Y400E1IN,laptop,Not value for money it's original price should be 60k and discounted should be around 45k. Only has 60Hz display and still only 1650 which is very basic.

Lenovo-15-6-inch-Fingerprint-Aluminium-20TDS0G300,laptop,Battery backup is not as mentioned on Amazon website. Additional Finger lock is not working properly. Slightly more heating than aspected. 1st time I tried Lenovo and experience is not not up to the mark. It is better to choose HP or Dell.
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Fingerprint-Aluminium-20TDS0G300,laptop,"I am writting this review after 2 months of use. I was thinking if expensive items can be purchase online or not ,forutanetly it's impressive laptop than any laptop.i have hp g6 laptop it's better than hp. Picture quality is beautiful,sound quality is good.As of now no complanits"
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Fingerprint-Aluminium-20TDS0G300,laptop,"I purchased the Lenovo thinkpad E14 on May 25, 2021. The 8 GB RAM allows to perform heavy applications run much faster. The fingerprint sensor is also cool and the laptop boots within seconds as soon as powering it on. I am really glad to enter into the Lenovo family."
Lenovo-15-6-inch-Fingerprint-Aluminium-20TDS0G300,laptop,"Awesome performance, good battery life,excellent thermals,light weight,screen is good."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,"As many people have pointed out here, that the laptop comes with 2 months warranty already used.  I had read those reviews and assumed that the known issue will take a phone call to resolve and went ahead with the purchase.  The warranty status was the first thing I checked and it showed 10 months remaining, I raised it immediately with the hp team but it hasn't been revolved yet after a week after several calls and several proof of purchase submitted. This makes me wonder what's the point of warranty anyway when their support team can't even resolve issues they've created by themselves."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,"Please do not go by the ratings or best selling tag for this laptop. I heavily regretted buying this from amazon. The screen went dead after 10 days. HP was ready to replace but Amazon says they will not take it back (despite HP was ready to issue the letter). If you still want to go ahead with this product, please buy it from a store, do not order online."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,I loved it in first look so fast from asus i5 laptop
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,Great purchase
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,"We did a research for the specs and found this as the cheapest option among Dell, Lenovo, Acer, Asus and other brands. Did not consider MI brand. Fastest to boot with 8 GB RAM. 256GB SSD for fast search and save. Comes with Windows 10 Home and Office Home Preconfigured. So you can start working from Day 1. Battery backup is good though the laptop gets a bit heated up when you use it continuously for more than 4 hours. 15.6 inch screen is good and Full HD. No touch screen but ours is a mouse pad and wireless mouse generation. Separate Number pad on the keyboard is a bonus. Could have given backlit keyboard but hey, we don't work in the dark! The plasticky feeling is there but the built is rugged and good rubber support at the bottom does not allow the laptop to move around on the table. Could have done with more USB port as one is permanently used by the wireless mouse and the USB C type is used for the external hard disk. Printing something at the same time is a challenge. But thanks to wireless printer that challenge is also taken care of. Overall just go for it if you are looking for basic laptop for business or leisure or for students. This one beats it all. Best i3 Laptop in town so far with 11th Gen Intel Chipset. Don't read other reviews and get disheartened. This is my fifth laptop purchase from amazon. Just close your eyes and go for it! The anti glare screen does not reflect anything like touch screen laptops. Brightness also 250 nits. Sound quality is amazing and it has Alexa Built-in so you can go ahead and enjoy your fav music on the go. Laptop is very light and best part is the charger is compatible with all HP laptops."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,"I notice that the laptop screen is yellowish as compared to my other laptop even though the night light setting is OFF. I have tried calibrating the display, turning off nightlight and adjusting the color temperature in the display settings."
HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,"The laptop is good, better than my expectations, is sleek and OS loads quickly. Good for normal work, Roblox and other light games. Serious games not tried. Works well with fedora video editor.  Update 2 months - Very satisfied."

HP-Processor-39-62cms-Integrated-15s-fq2075TU,laptop,HP provided back light keyboard in the same model. But when you purchase this model on Amazon this feature and some other features are also not available. It's look like that Amazon made this at own under the brand name HP. After lodging complain in this regard customer care said that they can not help in this. Moreover on Amazon site its MRP mentioned as 45999/- when item was delivered its MRP mentioned 44908/-. This confirms that Amazon has no brand warranty and they selling own manufactured laptop.

The price is a bit high at 42k but you couldn't get anything better at this hard times. Also there isn't any bank offer now, but if you can get this during sale its a great deal.  #WHO CAN USE IT: Programmers for visual studio stuff and aws, Word, excel, movies, low end gaming like gta vice city etc. Online classes and zoom meetings. All these things will just work flawlessly and you can even multi task to a great extent. But if you want much better performance and i5 CPU get this HP laptop here amazon.in/gp/product/B08XNYN5QV . Its overall a better device.  #Things I like: - Lightweight design. Looks thin - IPS FULL HD display - 8 GB DDR4 RAM - i3 11th gen, the latest one - SSD 256GB, which is a must - Windows 10 with MS Office Pre installed - Performance is good, boots in 5-10 sec, shutdowns in 3-5 sec - Average battery backup for moderate users (4-5hours)  #Things to note: - No backlight keyboard - Sound could be better - Built quality is not metal, it's plastic - 720p web cam not up to the mark - No fingerprint sensor for unlocking  I hope it helps. -Aj"

MSI-i5-10500H-IPS-Level-Windows-10SCXR-655IN,laptop,Good 💻 for gaming. Screen quality is better and 64gb ram is more for every day use🙄. Overall OK laptop
MSI-i5-10500H-IPS-Level-Windows-10SCXR-655IN,laptop,"Overall this is a fantastic laptop, it's packed with great components from the i5 to the GTX 1650 and has no trouble playing any of my games at max settings with great FPS. Dragon center and the steel series engine are easy to use set up your keyboard RGB and fan settings how you like them.there sre some design flaws with device on its heating issue, but to make a better performance it has to emit . Aoverall this is a great laptop that I am very happy with and would give it 4.5/5 but for a device heating while working does not deserve 0.5 cut so a full 5/5"
MSI-i5-10500H-IPS-Level-Windows-10SCXR-655IN,laptop,"Absolute Monster for gaming and all other stuffs. It definitely exceeded my expectations, Really really satisfied with the performance & viewing experience as well , you don't have think of an upgrade for 2 years... Go for it."
MSI-i5-10500H-IPS-Level-Windows-10SCXR-655IN,laptop,"Committed to advancing user experiences through the finest product quality, intuitive user interface and design aesthetics, MSI is a leading brand that shapes the future of technology."

Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"I'd pre-ordered the laptop when it lauched and was super excited to check it out when it arrived before the specified date.  I was disappointed when i realized that the backlight controls were not working. No option to customize the lighting scheme too. A quick google search about the issue revealed that the problem was fairly common.  Tried updating the softwares, bios etc as suggested in the forums to no avail. Called lenovo customer care, was kept on hold for around 30 mins. I got fed up and disconnected. Finally i reached out to amazon support who scheduled a technician visit to decipher the issue. On the inspection day, the touchpad stopped working as well. The technician said that the problems could be due to some underlying hardware defects.  Initiated a refund immediately. Say what you want about how expensive apple products are, such QC issues rarely occur. Paying close to 1.4 lacs and encountering such issues is an absolute travesty."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,Pre ordered and got it on 7th August.  Day-1 experience: started playing Doom Eternal. Observations: 1) Very smooth gameplay and got that high definition gaming vala feeling. 2) Laptop build quality is Amazing and sturdy. Feels Premium. 3) This laptop comes with 6GB graphics - when set at suitable high end settings and played doom enternal - after a while fan noise increases (this is expected for high intense tasks) but did not feel much heat on the keyboard and game went very very smooth without any disturbance. note: I played continuously for 2.5 to 3 hrs only 4) Laptop's Audio output is decent 5) The 720p Webcam is ok 6) Price- i am really not sure if this is high or reasonable compared to other gaming laptops. I personally like Lenovo. (I have an ideapad bought in 2016 and it is still pretty much alive and not a single problem - so I built the trust from here)  Planning to play other games as well from Xbox game pass and will update the review or post a youtube video.  But as of day 1 : 5 stars and loved it!
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,Products brought from Amazon comes with only one year warranty only. Trying to resolve the issue . Now the issue has been resolved. The very cooperative Lenovo team helped me out and the product warranty updated to three years.
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"This is the best gaming performance I've had from a system ever. Moving from Nitro 5 to this has been a heavenly experience. Tried a few games, some GPU heavy and some CPU heavy and wasn't disappointed.  The only reason I'm reducing 1 star from this feedback is that there seems to be software issues with Lenovo's proprietary software that they themselves don't know what to do about.  Their inhouse software Lenovo Vantage which is supposed to be used to control everything about the laptop including the backlighting of the keyboard has some options missing from the ones they advertise online. My particular model doesn't have any option to modify or turn off the backlighting so now it is stuck in a flashy rainbow loop endlessly. Even though people who have received this laptop in other parts of the world haven't faced this issue, I've seen a couple of people reporting this problem in India and Lenovo support is completely clueless as to how this can be resolved  Edit: Dropping the review down to 1 star based purely on the experience with Legion 'Premium' Tech Support. Every time you call them they have the same response, they run the automatic diagnostic tool on the Lenovo website (which I did before even contacting them) and when that doesn't resolve the issue, they say they'll get back within a day and then there is no response. You need to keep calling for follow ups. After a week of having this laptop, five days out of which I have been on tech support calls for over an hour (including the hold) , their resolution is, ""We can't be bothered to check where this issue is coming from even though people have been reporting it for over a month now. We will not send a software patch to fix this issue. We can replace the device for you"". When I asked for the replacement they redirected me to Amazon and since it's out of stock on Amazon now, their only response is return the device and take your money back. Nobody wants to actually work towards finding a solution even though this has been present on Lenovo forums for quite some time now (Lenovo forums are as useless, in case anybody was wondering). Even though the laptop is amazing, and I considered just using it with the flashing rainbow in my face all the time, the way Lenovo has acted here tells me how they'll handle any other issues in case they arise in the future and it isn't very promising. Won't recommend."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"There is no option to change lighting pattern or customize the behaviour in lenovo vantage software. Key shortcut is also not working. After 2 days of troubleshooting by myself and lenovo customer care, I've returned the laptop."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"(1 month usage update below)  I read a lot of reviews before I got this. Things that I was concerned about - - might seem plasticky - keyboard and trackpad might be uncomfortable - weight - size - speakers - heat for regular mobile usage (couch, chair) while not gaming  I have not used it for any gaming yet so don't have any observations around that.  Overall - does not feel plasticky at all. Nice premium feel overall. Looks and feels great.  Keyboard and trackpad were my biggest concerns but they are good. I don't have issues. Keyboard is super nice to type. Takes some getting used to - especially around the backspace key area. Typing speed was around my usual 75 wpm.  Size and weight - fits my laptop backpack which used to fit a 14"" Razer Blade. It is largish but not crazily so. Using it feels like having a monitor on your lap. Gorgeous display and nice to use, see and read. Definitely heavy but manageable.  Speakers - good enough for me. I had no issues. Sufficiently loud and clear.  Heat - I intend to use this on the couch or chair a lot and didn't want it to be uncomfortably warm or HAVE to use a lap table or desk. It is cool always (not gaming) and very comfortable to use. I use it mostly in the quiet mode and it really is completely quiet. Absolutely no concerns here so far.  Pricy as usual in India but overall very happy with the purchase. Hope it lasts me a while. Recommend big time!  ****** Update after 1 month of regular usage *****  Quiet Mode is very cool and quiet but takes a lot of performance away. Switching to balance is a huge boost in performance. When connected to power, balanced mode seems like the way to go.  Battery - I keep mine to battery saver (60% charge only). With 60Hz refresh rate, quiet mode I get about 3 and a half hours of battery life without gaming for regular usage. I find this quite reasonable for my usage currently.  Gaming - I only play AoE2 DE. That works just great.  Issues: - Occasionally, Fn + R will stop changing refresh rate. The only solution I know so far (haven't researched enough) is to reboot. But refresh rate can be changed from Advanced Display Settings even when Fn + R stops working.  - Very rarely, trackpad can be a little annoying during gaming but easy enough to switch off.  - Not an issue, but an annoyance - some Lenovo advertisement for some performance services used to pop up in the first couple of weeks. Haven't noticed it recently.  - I still hit num lock instead of backspace after all these weeks :-)  Most issues are quite trivial and very manageable.  I still like this laptop very much and will keep the 5 stars."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"Gaming - You can't find better than it in the whole world within this price range!  Battery life - Oh!if your main focus is to get more and more battery life,then please stay away from it.  Content creation - It has a QHD panel(16:10) which comes with 100% sRGB.You can easily imagine about it's productivity.Just get it!  Value for money - Everything is best in it in this price range,except the 1Rx8 dual channel ram sticks(Still it is beating some of the rtx 3070 laptops with it's full powered rtx 3060 variants)  Verdict - If your main concern is gaming or productivity and you got the budget,blindly go for it.If you just want batterey life and lightweight laptop,then don't go for it,it's somewhat heavy.But I am also a college student and I didn't face any problem for it's weight still now."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,Excellent performance for both gaming and productivity tasks.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Inspiron-5410-D560476WIN9S,laptop,"Good one with I5 and touch screen. Has been working well for close to month now. Fast and easy, comes with windows and office. was quick and easy to set up. Watch for discounts to buy at cheaper prices during offer time."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"The laptop's built quality of top-notch and full metal alloy construction. Keyboards has good travel distance and no!!! There is no RGB lighting problem. Check attached pics. I'm not gonna bore u with laptop details. You also get 1 months x Box game pass subscription. Laptop heats up during gaming, I would suggest using a cooling pad or an elevated stand it so that it can suck up more air and keeps the laptop cool. Only disappointed because didn't get a free backpack which u would have otherwise gotten if ordered from Lenovo's website. And the power brick is1 kg and in total is 3.5 kg with the laptop so portibility is not an option. Overall superb laptop with great performance. Can easily recommend. Update: The laptop comes with Intel wifi card not realtek. Check attached pic."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"Initially thought that the 16"" laptop was a bit bulky, but it turned around to be much like any other 15.6"" laptop as the bezzels are so thin.  Those who are looking for a productive and gaming laptop, just go for it. The 16"" 165Hz QHD display is perfectly calibrated.  For the gamers, the thermals are quite stable and you will not hear the fans running unless and until you are playing graphic intensive games.  The sound quality is good. Thanks to the built-in application Nahimic which brings immersive sound experience to your speakers as well as external headphones or other output devices. Another main feature is that with this, you can connect to two bluetooth/plugged in headphones at the same time and the laptop stream sounds without any audio lag. There is also an additional option with the Nahimic app we can change the surrond sound, volume stabilizer, bass and treble and there are 5 profiles for the sound- music, movie, communication, gaming and smart. All the modes have very different characteristics.  I havn't tested the HDR and Dolby Vision but i am sure that it will do a great job with this gorgeous display.  Coming to the waranty part, you get three years of waranty which can be seen while taking Lenovo Vantage preintalled app and 13 months of Legion ultimate support. The screenshot has been attached with this review.  Will get 1 month of Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft Office home and student 2019 with this machine.  Will update further if I find anything else"
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"The Legion 5 Pro is an absolute beast of a computing machine! The thermals are excellent even in the scorching Indian summers, the 2560*1600 16:10 display with VESA certified HDR400 is a marvel to look at, and the build quality is as solid as it gets for a gaming laptop. The entire laptop has a metallic finish and feels solid to the touch. The rubber stands underneath the laptop are deep enough to allow for considerable airflow but I would recommend raising the back atleast a few inches during intense gaming sessions. The keyboard has a soft-touch finish to it and it is a pleasure to type on."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"Every feature of this laptop is amazing. But the RGB keyboard has some serious issues. It's not getting customized in the Lenevo Vantage app as well via the keybaord shortcut. This is a global issue with a lot of units. You can find the same issue on Lenevo website forums in detail. Few other buyers here on amazon mention the same issue as well.  I have initiated a return as I am not getting a replacement. Lenevo Ultimate Support is pathetic. You won't be able to reach out to them most of the time. I was lucky enough to get in touch with them and their customer guy gave a wrong e-mail id for communication.  Buy this laptop if you can live with the faulty RGV keyboard. Otherwise, this is a beast laptop."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"Buy this laptop only if its in sale , because the performance your are getting from that price is very high Awsome design, great cooling, and also very quite i cant even hear the fan spining from it, great performance,awsome display,  But 1 drawback is the laptop is heavy but its portable. And the charger is also heavy  I will recommend anyone to buy this laptop"
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,Display and built quality are the best of all which stands out with its competitors. I spent some time playing valorant at medium settings. The cpu temp goes to 75 degrees and GPU temp goes to 60 degrees. You will definitely notice a difference in the display. It's the best display a gaming laptop has.i didn't any fps drops.
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,The legion 5 pro is. a beast There are many reviews and utube reviews i will keept it short 1. best cooling 2.sound is immense...its just awesome 3. display is qhd and bezel less...just feels heavenly while gaming or watching a movie because it had hdr+ certified 4. gpu is rtx 3060 130 tgp and it cam almost play any game ..i get 100+ fps in highest settings in gta V and the 165Hz refresh rate is just awesome if u are switching from 60 to 165 5. fps games are running so smooth..u will love it 6. 3 years warranty...XD WOW Cons 1. since its a beast it consumes. a lot of power so yeah average battery life ..bcox 165Hz screen also consumes power so when you are not gaming u can switch on hybrid mode 2. could have been cheaper a bit but perfect at this price range 3. the vantage app is so odd and not much features are availble  Cons dont value much .. just listen to this Go for it...beacuse this is the best GAMING laptop thank you
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,Can't change RGB. Stuck in rainbow loop. On the verge of returning.
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"Received the laptop today and it is as just as in the description i.e. just wonderful and amazing. The only thing is that delivery guy brought the package to me without the box from Amazon but it was sealed so accept it and Amazon must be careful from next as laptops are fragile so maximum protection is needed. Also, while buying the laptop from Amazon they didn't seems to send the bag as well which is a disadvantage means you need to purchase bag seperately overall there is no issues with the laptop or anything and if you need a gaming laptop just go for this one and won't regret it."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"Lenovo Legion5 -PRO is highly recommended, its the only laptop worth buying for its price point, got mine delivered by amazon in 4 days, been using it for 2 weeks, comes with a surprise 3 year warranty by default. the gaming performance is awesome , specially since it is the only laptop in India with a non crippled GPU . battery life in quiet mode is almost 6 hours, little lower than 8 hour advertised under ideal conditions. if you want to buy a laptop primarily for gaming, go for it, the CPU and GPU are both non crippled, and as far as i know, its the only laptop with full 130W NVIDIA 3060 GPU . and yes laptop is heavy ,great build quality , and heat is not an issue ,just don't keep it on your lap when gaming and you are fine."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,I disliked nothing and i liked everything
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,What a beauty. In love with the screen and this beast is insanely fast. Ssd inside is too good.
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,Excited for this one! God speed delivery by Amazon! Thanks.
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,Best for Gaming
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,its good
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"The pros of this laptop have been covered in detail. It is a fantastic laptop. However 2 cons of this laptop :  1. Nvidia has played a cruel trick. The 3060 mobile GPU comes with only 6GB VRAM. Modern games are already hitting the 6GB VRAM limit for ultra textures. So even with the incredible performance of the 130W 3060 included in this laptop, in 1 year you can no longer game in Ultra after spending this much money which is a bit frustrating. Closely follow announcements of new games. Most require 8GB for ultra textures. With DLSS and FSR the fps can be boosted but textures still cannot be contained in the small VRAM. I already face stuttering in such games when VRAM overflow happens. Learn from my mistake. I hope you keep this in mind. Consider getting the Legion with RTX 3070 if your budget permits as it will be future proof for atleast 4 years.  2. Overpriced - Beware the price. The laptop should be sold with a maximum price of 137999. From the price history of this product that can be found, this is evident. The msp Lenovo officially declared is 139999. Some retailers are selling for an inflated price of 154999. This is very close to the price of a 3070 laptop with 8GB VRAM that Lenovo has declared. So one should absolutely NOT buy a 3060 version at an inflated price. I was able to get from Lenovo official website for as low as 1.3L when in stock. Be sensible !! Don't let your emotions get the better of you. The 6GB VRAM is reason enough to absolutely NOT go over 1.4L with your purchase.  Happy gaming"
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"I purchased this from a Lenovo certified offline store at Nehru Place. This thing is outstanding. From Aluminium body to the gorgeous screen to the performance of RTX 3060.  I bought this for Graphic Design, Motion graphics & 3D Rendering. This thing performs so well while being cool enough. RTX 3060 6GB is pretty enough for my usage at the moment, does not over heat. Most impressive thing about this machine is the screen and build quality.  The only thing i was disappointed in is Realtek Wi-Fi card. It was supposed to be the intel one. I am going to raise a complaint about it.  But over all I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. Last but not least, my device came with dual channel 8GBx2 rams. Performing well. Watch Jarrod's video if your device shipped with 16GB single channel ram. Warranty was 1 Year On-site & 1 Year ADP. I contacted to the sales team of Lenovo though email and provided them the necessary document and now the issue is resolved. 3 years On-Site warranty & 1 Year of ADP with Ultimate support. Purchased extended ADP support for 2 years worth 2500 INR also."
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"Be aware before buying!!! Laptop’s igpu not working, screen flickers a lot and amd drivers not detecting igpu so i had to refund my product and this is a serious issue some time keyboard rgb not working ..otherwise laptops performance is vey good lenovo should fix this igpu problem..thank u"
Lenovo-40-64cm-500Nits-Warranty-82JQ0062IN,laptop,"They could have also offered a lower specced variant with 512GB of SSD and MS DOS instead of Windows 10, since many of us are upgrading our older laptops which have an SSD with Windows installed on it. We'd just need to install that in this laptop. Would have ended up at approx. 1.15 lacs."

Dell-i5-1135G7-Inspiron-5410-D560476WIN9S,laptop,"This is a 2-in-1 laptop is suitable for office work.  Image quality of the display is alright but I feel like Dell should have at least put in a display with 100% sRGB coverage.  Overall performance is smooth and snappy thanks to the Intel 11th gen processors, RAM and fast internal drive speeds.  Pros and cons at a glance + Compact design that looks good + Thin bezels + 1080P resolution still adequate for a 14-inch display + 1.5 kg + Smooth snappy overall performance + Excellent keyboard, typing experience + Intel Graphics card good for some 1080P gaming + Good selection of ports + RAM and PCI NVMe SSD user upgradeable + Note taking performance is quite good - Trackpad occasionally registers click+hold instead of click - Downward facing speakers sound hollow - Maximum battery life just 5 hours with the 3-cell battery - Dell Active Pen has higher than preferred initial activation force. - Glass display is too smooth for drawing, but good for writing - Glass display little reflective - microSD card slot not as useful as SD card slot"
Dell-i5-1135G7-Inspiron-5410-D560476WIN9S,laptop,This product was soldby APPARIO RETAIL PVT LTD and within 2 days after it was delivered the screen got dead Presume the product was not original rather refurbished
Dell-i5-1135G7-Inspiron-5410-D560476WIN9S,laptop,"I wanted the product for personal use and had certain expectations. Expectation#1 - Good Battery life: Should recharge quickly (which it does), but then battery drains quickly too. *Not satisfied* Expectation#2 - Smooth Pen's response for writing and marking documents: It requires significant pressure to write on the screen at the usual writing angle, when using like a pad the keyboard is active and hence affects the use as a pad. *Not satisfied* Expectation#3 - Good design and Ergonomics: Laptop is heavy enough to be used as a pad, edges are sharp, and mouse pad response is far from perfect. At ~Rs. 70k this is expensive instead it is better to use that budget for clamshell (not 2-in-1) laptops with better RAM and processor speed. Hope this helps."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Inspiron-5410-D560476WIN9S,laptop,"Bought this laptop on the day of launch in Amazon. Before buying this laptop, I had visited all the brand showrooms, spent half a day visiting Dell, Lenovo, HP, Asus and finally decided to buy this Dell Laptop. Comparing Lenovo Yoga 7 and Asus, Dell was much cheaper. HP was cheaper than Dell but Dell has a good built and much better features. The pen has to be bought separately in HP. Only Lenovo and Dell provide it with the laptop in the box.  This 2in1 Dell costs Rs.2,500 more in Dell showroom and website but you get a laptop bag free which is included."

It's not a gaming laptop...so if u r looking for a gaming laptop..please don't consider this...as it has iris integrated graphics...as a result..the graphics will share the same 8GB ram...causing load onto the system.

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Was excited for this laptop until it got delivered today and turns out to be a huge disappointed primarily due to its poor screen / display compared to the cost of the product wherever superiors display was expected as bare necessary. Resolution is extremely poor when it comes to sharpness of alphabets, Numbers, charts, other internet text etc that it takes a toll on your eyes as if you had poor vision (you often feel as if the eyes can't focus on those alphabets). Not even a day and i wish to return this laptop but company policy doesn't permits so. Please don't put your money in this laptop and go for other better brands as Asus or Dell."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"As with the looks its very sleek, lightweight and the colour is dark grey which gives it a classy look. It has a matte finish all over. The keyboard is comfortable to type and the font of print on it is big which is good even if you keep your laptop at distant. There is two light settings for the backlight on the keyboard which to me seems pretty useful. The battery backup is also good and no heating issues as such. I did observe that it charges up quickly.  The only con I feel is that the colour scheme of display is slightly warmer in tone. If we had an option to make it cooler than I would have zero complaints. But the warmer tone is easy on eyes so that's personal choice.  Overall its the best Machine in this budget, a student can definitely go for it without hesitation for everyday chores and more."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,powerful machine but a bit heavy ..
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"I purchased this laptop on 29 June 2021 for ₹63k. I wanted a laptop which was light and thin and also had a good battery life. I also had desires for Mid-Level Gaming and trying out different stuffs on Adobe Phostoshop,etc.  One Word- It worked Perfectly.  PROS:  1. i5 11th gen which even has better CPU handling than gaming laptops priced at ₹1 lac. 2. Iris Xe Graphic Card has worked wonders in handling everything from Gaming to editing. 3. The Display is also commendable with Anti Reflective screen which makes sure you don't get disturbed during browsing. 4. Battery Life is on 5-7 hours level from Moderate to Low Use range. 5. Comes with Pre Installed Microsoft Office Home and Student and saves ₹3k which we would have to spend externally. 6. Also, the 1TB HDD with 256 SSD is a big boost to the computer storage. 7. A backlit keyboard to help during night time. 8. Fingerprint scanner for added security.  FEATS: 1. 13 Tabs playing 4k videos on Chrome at 95% capacity of RAM. 2. GTA 5 on 1440p at 50-55FPS (Lag Free) 3. Rocket League at Max Settings at 1440p at 80 FPS 4. BOOT TIME - <5 seconds average.  CONS: 1. The only problem is RAM. Mine is 8GB one (4X2 Dual channel) which is soldered into the motherboard. So its going to be a problem for me in future with Games but not in general. If you want, you can take 16GB variant one but it will cost ₹5k more and only 512GB SSD available.  Overall, this is not a gaming Laptop so 16GB will always be overkill. For general surfing and Word document and PPT work ( For a Student), it works wonders.  Recommended for those who want Storage + Battery + Mid level Gaming + Light Laptop."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,its is a perfect banlance of hardware and price ....i will post full review on sunday....it is a must buy
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Updated review after 6months of usage: All the points mentioned below are same. I bought same laptop one more time for my wife's office usage. Daily usage for me is minimum 10 hours which increases on weekends due to binge watching. Running smooth. Lenovo keeps updating drivers, bios, etc which keeps the system updated. Happy with my decision to buy it. Good product, pricy but it has 11th gen processor which means it is 30% faster then older gen, techies can co relate with it. I have bought it for work from home , I work on virtual cloud and I have found the laptop to be versatile for software development. Display is good but don't expect MacBook type display for movies or online streaming, sound is ok but for zoom meetings it is very much sufficient. I haven't used headset on this laptol so far for meetings, the inbuilt Mike is also powerful, avoids surrounding noise. Keyboard has rich feeling, trackpad could have been better but probably I am comparing apple with oranges. Of course it is not a match to MacBooks trackpad. Best part of thsi laptop is lightening fast shutdown and startup due to addition NVM sata drive where your windows is installed. Lenovo upgrades are very easy , they notify through email for any update. Very well managed on that front. Webcam is very clear. Overall performance is good . This review is after 6 weeks of usage , daily 10 hours minimum. One more point to note is battery performance, My usage is heavy and I g t good 7-8 hours minimum. I still test it every day. And charging is super quick. Here it matches MacBook and in battery life, out petforms MacBook. Not as light and as compact and as sturdy as MacBook but overall the looks are very premium and rich looking. Keyboards are in the race to stand up against the Mac. Windows 10 is also competing very well with Mac in terms of ease of access and this is coming from a person who was Mac user for last 4-5 years. Though it seems pricy when you do comparision with other i5 laptops but then be assured, technically it is at higher place for few things , aethetics and performance fetches the actual browny points. I was sceptical initially but now I feel it was a good decision. my research was fruitful. I will recommend it to software developers."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Pros System performance is fine, battery back up 9 hours in light usage, light weight to carry. Cons System at times does not start. When contacting customer care, they say it is due to static charge.. and i have brought this machine 20 days ago and i have to discharge for more than 7 times. I am a daily user minimum 4 hours to 8 hours.. still this issue persists (they say static charge accumulate when you are not frequent user). And also the audio drivers are at times not recognized. Because the board is new, i think there are many drivers they have to update.. in a nut shell, don't buy this laptop just now, they are still working on it. And lenovo customer care is horrible.. even premium care is not at all satisfactory. Pls don't buy lenovo"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Keyboard of desk is very fragile and it is not good within 15 days of purchase the keys are han detached and it is handled by professor so very bad experience
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Even though the specification of the system is decent, the build quality is very bad. This is not the quality of the product expected from Lenovo with the price range around 70K. There was no physical damage nor the laptop is used very rough. This is the current situation of the product by just opening and closing the lid within 5 months of purchase."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,I have been using this laptop for 6 months now. Pros: Good performance Long battery life  Cons: Cheap build quality Fragile  The hinge just came off without any physical damage. Thankfully it was covered under warranty and was repaired.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Received used product with 9 month of warranty..laptop is slow and lagging...
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-MB-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,It is not necessarily a gaming laptop but great for low end office work for lots light weight and easy portability.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Had to return the laptop after using 15 days because of Bluetooth connectivity problem. My review basis using it for 15 days as below:  What i liked: 1. Strong and sturdy built. Looks very elegant and high end. 2. Boot time very fast. 5-7 secs max. 3. Fingerprint reader pretty responsive. 4. Battery life is good. With continuous video & audio calls, battery lasts for 3-4 hours with full charge. 5. Sound output also decent as speakers are on on top.. Just above the keypad. 6. Keyboard & touchpad is very good. Keys seem to be quite strong. Backlit keyboard with options of changing the intensity of backlight is helpful. 7. As screen is anti glare, hence it is very soothing to eyes. 8. Didn't experience any lag or heating issue.  What i didnt like: 1. Web cam quality was average. Was expecting a better quality given the high price laptop. My 8 yr old HP630 has a better web cam. 2. The font / text on screen does not come out sharp. Seems bit blurry. Initially i did not notice this but after reading a similar review by another user, this became quite evident. Actually it is. Could be because of the IPS lcd screen. 3. The keys of the keypad is almost at the same level of the board i.e. not much raised. So it was bit uncomfortable given that we are used to feel the keys going down when pressed. I think over time one will get used to it. 4. My fingers are big and on the thicker side. Had some difficulty in typing as the keys are very near to each other.  So overall i would say it was a pretty good experience except the web cam and the softness of the fonts/text display.  While buying from Amazon please do check that the invoice and pslip has the laptop serial number mentioned in it. Otherwise Lenovo team will refuse to provide any support. In case you need to get the warranty period corrected, than lenovo team will ask for the invoice with serial number. Lenovo team had agreed to replace the laptop (because of the Bluetooth problem i was facing) but required the invoice with serial number on it. It took me almost 10 days and multiple follow ups with Amazon to get the revised invoice. By the time i got the invoice, the laptop was already returned.  Had requested for engineer visit from Amazon because of the problem being faced. Extremely pathetic service. Despite giving time for visit no one comes. Appointment scheduled twice and no one came."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"It is ridiculous I bought this brand new item and it is not working no body responding and I feel shame because I given a gift to my cousin, I spent big money but I feel very bad to Amazon I will never order any thing from you people"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"All dislikes only, no likes for this product. Be as much attentive as you can be but you won't hear anything from the speakers, display is worst, battery backup also worst ...what good the processor can do when you can't see or hear anything. Cheery on the top.... Negligence from Amazon towards replacement request...that too twice...now replacement period is over and 70000/- in hell ."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,This is the best combination of specifications I was looking for (SSD + 1TB HDD + 2GB DEDICATED GRAPHICS) ...My view after one week of use ~ Starting up with the look because it gives classic premium look. Keys are also upto satisfaction can type smoothly and backlit feature is very helpful with two options of light (dim lighting and heavy lighting). This machine wakes very quick and ready to work big tasks in about 10 seconds. I don't find heavy heating issues like the other machines during heavy gaming and multitasking. Heatsup reasonably and cools down very quickly. Display is the only drawback it could have been better at this cost but that's also not big issue it doesn't make the laptop that bad. I always use it in dark room and low display 🔅 light so I don't find it a problem. body is slim but not too light as it was said. Everything else is fine performance is awesome I'm satisfied. Got this for 68.6K on 15th Jan price could have been like 3k less for this machine but overall it's good.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Loved the laptop. Quick start. Windows 10 /MS Office pre-installed. Finger print access. Privacy shutter for webcam quite useful as a safety measure.  My use is usually MS Office, Zoom, Adobe, web surfing, YouTube, Netflix (at times, if don't want view on TV or mobile), a bit of video editing. My son plays his games hence the graphics card version helps.  I usually prefer the SSD + HDD combination, it gives storage space as well as speeds up the programs. On installation of laptop, suggest the user changes default storage paths of documents, images, videos, music and all such files to HDD i.e. D:/ . Laptop default is SSD i.e. C:/  Speakers are quite good, better than many. But I think sound can be better and louder in living room with conversation as well as TV on. They could use technology of the clear, and loud sound of B&O speakers from select HP laptops.  Will add to the review after using the laptop more after a few months.  We loved the 1st piece so we bought the same model and configuration 2nd piece for my kid too. I sold my old laptop outside for 19k as Amazon was giving only 10.5k for it (Amazon is still better than Flipkart, where they never take exchange products on some fake pretext. Further, Amazon products are at least genuine, while Flipkart we may get pre-used also)  We also managed to get our Bank's credit card cash discount offer on non-EMI payments. So my overall deal was quite good."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Average battery with just 2.15 hours of backup but shows battery indicator as 3.15 hours.. But definitely not 8 or 11 hours as mentioned in company's website..... I have tried all possible power modes with customs settings but no improvement. But the processor is super fast in booting.... Not a solid keyboard make, which is the only drawback... But most of the brands in this range have similar build quality... So take your best bet in this aspect. Genuine buyer review Bonus... There is really 30 days free trial version of mcafee virus scanner.... Which is not mentioned in the spec anywhere."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,internal parts got damaged
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"While opening and closing the laptop i got some creaking sound for few days and then suddenly on one day, I was unable to open it. The frame came out whike trying to open even with slow pace."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  the worst laptop I had buyed it is not working sometimes and this bad product everytime i have to call customer care lenovo is not doing anything please dont buy
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Build quality, finish and look of the laptop is excellent. I use it for basic stuff such as browsing, online classes and some basic machine learning. So far runs smoothly and didn't face any issues. Just a tad disappointed with the battery backup of approx 5hrs whereas product claims 6-8 hrs but depends on other factors too. Audio quality is also good. Overall a good buy for me with exchange of my old laptop."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Configuration seems adequate for everyday home use, A very thoughtful layout and material choices make it weigh quite light. The screen resolution on this model could be higher to realise the full potential of its graphics card. Processor heat and fan noise seem minimum for now.(that need to be checked on long run with battery duration)"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Overall laptop is good except the screen. I was using lenovo ideapad 310 and compared to it, lenovo 5i screen color tone is little odd/dim. Without bezel in 5i, thought its 15 inch, the height of screen is low compared to 310 which makes its little hard for my neck to adjust to new screen position for longer duration."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Quality of items is not good it has been proved that Chinese items is worse item in this world. Side strips of the screen of this laptop has been automatically comes outs and broken from its hinges . I m not able to make a complaints and authorised dealer for show this problem
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,nice laptop for editing and multitasking
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,NA
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Light weight and best for college students! Sounds amazing! Solid build...
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Horrible experience. Received a faulty laptop. Went to the service center, and they said they will take a week to get a replacement motherboard. This is terrible, they should replace the laptop, given that it didn’t even turn on once since it arrived."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Good
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Battery is running out fastly.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Display not good Battery pathetic
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,After 2 months of using the laptop i am writing this review and it is really valuable for momey. Batery backup and starting in fraction of seconds and build quality is super. Keyboard and working with this laptop experiance is awesome.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Worst laptop Worst customer service even after purchasing Premium Customer Care service from Lenovo Don't buy Lenovo products
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Good laptop for home use
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Defective product. Complaint already lodged. Please replace immediately as promised by the customer service.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  the keyboard quality is so poor I've bought it in this month it self August 2021 and it's keyboard keys just came out after several use
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,It has hinge problem in most of the laptops...which shows up within one year...
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Smooth performance , slim and light great specs. Laptop cameras were never good . Just an amazing lenovo"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Good
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Nice laptop. Light weight and powerful. Decent display at this range. Does not heat excessively. Battery life is not bad but could be better.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,The battery life is good and value for money.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,IT IS VERY BAD BUILD QUALITY.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Nice product from Lenovo reviewing after 1 month of use goor product in this range...and battery life also more than 5hrs easily..
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Great Machine
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Product is good, as I want brand new package. Look and value wise also it very nice. You can trust and buy from here. 👍"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,U cannot game with it as its fps is very low after 50% of battery
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,value for money.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Value for money
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Overall a nice product. But speaker sound is bit low and it lacks bass.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Fast n convenient
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Good product, value for money"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,This laptop specs are very good but the only problem is the display. I thought its a ips display but after using the laptop. I can say display is very bad apart from display everything is awesome battery backup is 6-7 hours easily.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Overall amazing laptop...battery backup with light usage is around 10hours...and with YouTube and surfing - 6 to 7 hours....This is not gaming machine but still u can play fortnite @ low settings and get 100 to 150FPS ...BUT again it's not gaming machine...very handy laptop with slim design and portable charging option (Type c 65watt)
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Best device i have got in years, battery backup easily 7-8 hrs of sot,nvidia graphics card works like a charm, processor is blazing fast,wifi 6 and bt 5.1 provides seemless connectivity, cutting one star because the display doesn't provide the customisation options, otherwise best laptop for students and even work professionals👍👍"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,just awesome  all the things are best in this price range especially display local also better then others battery life is totally decent
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,I brought this laptop yesterday..... i'm writing review based on my experience..... This laptop display is quite good... coming to battery it takes 2hrs to charge and it discharges within 3 hrs max even company said we get 6hrs of battery backup.... coming to speakers it doesnt reach my expectations.... it is bit low.... if we connect headphones we can able to hear outside noise..... coming to keyboard it is excellent with backlight.... this is my overal review
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"All good but issue with the seller. As they are not mentioned laptop serial number , could not able to get extended warranty. So, you to buy the laptop at your own risk."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"It's a nice product, but seller not mentioned laptop serial number on invoice & laptop box, therefore I'm getting a trouble to extend his warranty from Lenovo. Recommended product."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"Great experience I bought it from lenovo store .But,i have to say very great product Looks very simple from outside and bewst from inside."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,Value for money so thankful to Lenovo Grate products thickness is very slim Nice operating keyboard is very sumtha good
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"This laptop is everything that u need for a day to day purpose. Well I'm not sure about this seller but even if you buy it in outmarket, u r not gonna regret thats for sure."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-MB-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,Very nice
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,Dark spots developed on screen
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"This is feedback is an initial reaction. I already own Lenovo Ideapad 330 and this laptop is our new addition. Combination of Tiger Lake, Iris Xe and MX450 makes the laptop smooth to use. Graphic performance is good and I expect it will improve further software update. I must say default settings of windows 10 ans FHD resolution graphics works like a charm. I can feel the difference when I switched back to ideapad 330. It would have been better if it has 512 GB SSD (it has only 256 GB NVME ssd) . By default hard disks are bit lock encrypted is a pleasant surprise. Need to back up the encryption key in a safe place.  Will write a detailed review after months of usage and I don't feel any heating issue while playing less graphic intense games. Only disappointment was that the charger adapter follows the same old fashion. I was expecting like small wall charger similar to mobiles."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010BIN,laptop,"I confirmed with Lenovo customer care helpline that with this laptop we can not extend RAM, so I suggest to Lenovo that it is worst things in this category laptop. Big failure or drawback. Please be aware if anyone buying this."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-MB-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,"Good screen (but not anti glare as mentioned). It's glossy and shiny. Laptop does not feel too laggy, as it is still new. Need to see after data fills up the disk. Booting is quick. Keyboard and Touchpad is ok but touchpad config is not present in settings. Therefore, it only operates like a mouse while scrolling and scrolls multiple lines at a time. Scrolling in all apps is not smooth due to that. No fan and therefore bottom gets moderately heated. Works for 4 to 5 hrs based on usage. Not many laptops are available at this price. Good for light work and browsing. Got for kids online classes. Camera is ok...but in little awkward position and we need to keep laptop tilted on books to be in view of the camera. Overall a good buy as few options are available at the price. Speakers are very average, low volume and no bass. Asus has some good options with similar specs and price but with HD screen. You can check those out too before buying. I bought 256GB version black color at Rs. 20999 after card discount."
AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-MB-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,The laptop packaging was very well done and it was sturdy. Overall the product is good for light office work or for small time business work. Purchasef it for a small time business work. Working fine until now. Only problem which I faced is after prolonged usage mouse pad stops working and the touchpad is very sensitive and delicate. Not even a touch of dust accumulation it can withstand-the drawback of the product. And the screen is also ok. Not very good. The mouse pointer also gets disappeared sometimes. And only one service center is there all over Bangalore. That's very problematic. If anything goes wrong then either go to local shop for repair or go to the only service center in Bangalore in her layout. Rest it serves my purpose. I would only recommend this product for light or small work. This processor is of celerion which is one of the oldest processor by Intel. Would definitely not recommend it for gaming or heavy duty works. Thank you for dropping by. Enjoy shopping..!!

Full HD screen is amazing. 4. Camera is crystal clear and captures in good quality.  Cons: 1. Camera placement could have been better. 2.

AVITA-Essential-NE14A2INC44A-MB-Celeron-N4020-Integrated,laptop,Very nice product in this price range.battery is good. Display is very good. Performance is also good because of SSD.

LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,"I have been looking for this laptop for a few months but have not bought it previously as I already have an HP high configuration Laptop but finally decided to buy it.  After two months, use my review.  1. Battery performance superb. The full day, I was surfing for more than 12 hours. 2. Display all adorable and attractive 17 Inches that's attracted to buy. 3.Backlit keyboard is superb. 4.Although 8Gb RAM is installed, I don't find any types of issues that work to the same extent as my 16GB Ram HP laptop. If you open more than 40 web pages, it is hanging maybe ram issue after the upgrade the ram will update this. 5.3 Years onsite warranty have to see how this works. But if you buy Dell or HP 3 yr, onsite warranty only cost you 15k plus. 6.Weight is also significantly less than my other brand laptop, only 1.4 Kg while on the outside. 7.I am sure after seeing this laptop review, other competitors Dell and HP will reduce their Price tag to buy high configurations at less price. 8.Speakers are also of outstanding quality.  It needs to be improved.  1.The body colour. However, it is a charming colour if it is more glossy, I mean pure silver.  Overall, This laptop is worth every penny. Go for this In EMI without thinking about alternatives.  Thanks to Amazon, finally."
LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,"The product is good for it's price in India. Obviously it is almost 30k higher than what it is in the US but that's what most fo the laptop companies do in India. The tax diffrences are not that big to create such a price difference but unfortunately most of the companies use this tactics in India.  However, coming to the laptop, this one of the best that I have experienced so far. I have dell, macbook, and Asus laptops in my family and I can certainly say that Dell has the best built among the all. However, LG has also done an incredibly great job with this laptop. I hoped that they could have provided a metal finishing aroud the screen as well. Rest all the things are fine.  Obviously, the specs are already mentioned, so I won't mention again. However note that the 17 inch screen is 16:10. And it is a 2k display. Based on the two, 80Wh battery gives around 8-10 hours of battery life with internet surfing and general work which is good considering screen size and resolution. You may lower the resolution to get better battery life but I did not like it after lowering the resolution and so kept it like that.  Also, the Ram and SSD are upgradable. I bought the 512/8 GB version. I upgraded to 1TB/16GB. NVMe SSD is supported. And Sodimm ram is supported. Ram is CL22 at 3200 MHz. So, I did not face any issues in performance either with 8 GB ram or 16 GB ram.  Games are not playable as it does not have graphics card. However, I could still play some old games like Prototype 2 and Prince of Persia the two thrones.  It is mostly targeted for business users as most of the daily tasks can be done and is ultra portable. Video editing is also possible but 4k editing is a bit slow.  Some people reported about heating issue which I also faced initially during charging but several updated later, I don't see that issue. It sometimes heats up during charging but not while using. Yes, it heats up during gaming as well but I'm personally not concerned about gaming as I didn't buy it for gaming. Though, if you are planning to buy a laptop for gaming,it is better to go for something with graphics card.  Con - The only major con I found was that this has the trackpad in the middle with a full keyboard which makes typing difficult. The trackpad is usually placed below the space bar. However, once you start using it, you'll get used to it after a few days. It took me almost a month to get used to the key position and the backspace especially because my last laptop had only alphabetical keys. LG could have improved that by placing the alphabetical keyboard with speakers on the side. Numeric keys might be useful for number crunchers.  Overall, I really liked the laptop, the build quality and screen is amazing to look at."
LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,"It heats a lot for basic tasks , i5 i a piece of garbage combined with the non existent fan of LG gram makes it worse (evo certification is just for putting basic things right , it doesn’t guarantee everything If you are a fan of good build please don’t go for it , it’s so flimsy and the screen wobbles even for a normal speed ceiling fan air Lg post sales service i don’t know please enquire if it’s available near you Resale value : don’t even expect anymore  Please remember this device is not returnable , don’t have a buyer’s remorse after buying it  1. Heating of Cpu cores upto 85 degrees celsius for basic tasks like Web browsing 2. Screen wobbling like Rubber. 3.Metalic finish is like pure plastic finish.- 4.Web cam - 1980 s VGA camera with Full grain. 5. Speakers Audio output = basic phone output.  Only Pro  Screen resolution and Clarity which is not a pro with these many cons"
LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,"I didnt know that LG also makes laptop. When I saw they are making 17"" laptops for a decent price I decided to give it a try. 1. Its super light weight, lighter than MacBook pro. It was a great surprise. 2. Its also very thin making it very easy to handle. 3. It has full keyboard which is a great plus but the layout is bit inconvenient and takes time to adjust 4. The speaker are located at the bottom and dont sound that great, if you want a laptop for playing music/movies dont depend on these speakers. 5.The internals are good, the speed is fine, I haven't tested it with a 3D software or Video editing software yet, so dont know how it will perform. 6. The default memory is 8G and you cant upgrade/customize it on amazon while buying it, you have to buy it from a 3rd party source which is a hassle. 7. The fingerprint login is a great, no need to use passwords anymore 8. Only one USB-C/Thunderbolt port, and 3 USB ports. I would have liked more USBC/Thunderbolt ports. 9. No ethernet port but they give your the USBC to ethernet adapter with it. 10. It has Intel's graphics card, which is generally not as good as NVIDIA's or AMD's but does perform well.  Summary : If you want a bg screen, lightweight thin laptop, this one fits the bill. the specs are decent for a general purpose laptop. I dont expect it to perform well for applications where a great performing graphics/CPU is needed."
LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,"Earlier I was thinking of getting the 11th gen version but its coming with LPDDR5 so the RAM won't be upgradable. Screen is awesome but its a glossy one so it may be an issue if you work outdoor a lot. Sound is good, could be improved. There is a bit of distortion at high volume. Not a glass Trackpad but its pretty smooth. If you're using it for browsing, documents, light games, etc it works fine without any issue. Starts lagging a bit if you do heavy graphic tasks or large video editing. It kinda starts giving up(but hey it wasn't meant for those tasks either) I was looking for a light &slim laptop with a nice display& good performance. This one ticks all of them and that too at a fair price. Asus, acer do have light ones but they come with small screen and are expensive.  GRAB IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!! It is worth every penny spent."
LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,Its a very well built ultra light 17 inch laptop. I needed a portable workhorse for my trading needs . So this ticks all my boxes. Battery life is very good not 19 hours as they mention but 10 hours on regular use is more than good for me on 17 inch qhd panel. Screen is fabulous. Wish lg did something to reduce the reflection of the panel. Ram is soldered not upgradable but 8 gb is enough for my trading needs. Ssd can be upgraded with additional m.2 slot. Those who know. They just buy gram . Its a premium device and was priced sensibly during launch.

LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,"Cant ask for more. A handfull of laptop. Simply the best laptop computer I have used so far. Battery does not last as advertised. But I get a decent 10 plus hours backup. In the last one week, I charged it only twice. Screen is a very big plus. Very clear and nice display. I reduce the resolution to use my engineering drawings and bring it back to recommended setting after my work is done. We need to wait for all apps to catchup with this resolution. Keyboard and touchpad are fluid. Fingerprint is a breeze. Some bloatware found. I uninstalled some and kept some that that I felt is of use. Speakers are quite good. I read reviews and saw videos and was waiting for a disastrous sound. But the sound is quite good. Most importantly, we can hear a full surround sound from these two speakers. The spacing is such that it feels like listening through headphones due to the size of the laptop.  I own many LG products, (refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher) and now this laptop. No brand loyalty at all. But I do a research of the quality before buying, and end up buying an LG product. (My TV is a different brand)  I believe the 2021 model is even better."
LG-i7-1065G7-17-inch-2560X1600-Windows,laptop,"its been a week, the laptop works fine, as mentioned is super light, even compared to 14/13"" laptop, but thats why it is flimsy, you will have to be careful plugging charging cable or usb into its ports.  who should buy it ? below are uniq features you will not find together in any laptop. if you like big screen, QHD(dont want 4k on laptop) and 16:10, my first req was 16:10 i hate 16:9 ratio, IPS display (IPS/glossy screen you can make matte by putting a film but a matte screen you cant change)  thunderbolt port with display and power delivery func.  good battery backup with i7 processor  basic IRIS graphics processor so that HQ videos dont lag or basic gaming dont lag (ideally i would have like nvidia MX series)  now lets see how far the hardware lasts, i am first tie buyer of LG laptop, i mean who buys LG laptop, lenovo and asus are much better hardware makers, but sadly they dont consider a small market for buyers like me."

Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"This is the best laptop under 70k, Period!  This is a right balance of design and performance. The look & design is so premium. 16 gb ram is brilliant, no other laptop offers it in this price range with such high end overall specs. The core raw performance of Ryzen 5700U is much higher than intel 11th gen i7. 512gb ssd, 300 nits anti glare panel, everything is top notch. And because of ryzen, it's gonna be much more battery efficient than intel. If they had made the display 100% sRGB, it would been a perfect laptop for anyone out there.  Its been only couple of days, I'll put in the final review along with pics, but make no mistake people, get this one over any other laptop with intel, the current gen can never out perform this especially at this price."
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"Ticks all the boxes for a personal computer. Has good power, GPU, SSD for quiet operation, sleek build, long battery life, fingerprint entry, fast boot-up, good looks - for professional use, backlit keys, privacy shutter for camera, thin bezels, and smooth Windows performance. Mind you, this is a review from someone who has used this only for 2 days, will update with a long-term review. I thought of purchasing a MacBook Air, but settled for this, owing to my Windows inertia (can't trust any other OS, or learn to function there), and also because AMD processors have improved a great deal."
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"Ryzen 7 5700U processor with 16Gb RAM and nvme SSD is a pretty decent combination for running multiple apps(eclipse, mysql, tomcat, multiple browsers) simultaneously for core development. Its been just a week and am already loving the performance of this machine. Screen is crisp and anti-glare. Backlit keyboard just works like a charm. With merely 1.6kg, its a value for money device. Must buy for developers. Will post a thorough and detailed review a month later."
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"Writing this review after 1 day of use. I bought this product for professional usage. So this review is not for gamers. My usage is limited to Virtual Box VMs, Multiple tabs for browsing (30 mininum) and Music only. This is good laptop for IT professionals as AMD Ryzen is far better than Intel processor. Laptop Display is crystal clear with no lag. Laptop comes with McAfee 30 days trial and inbuilt Defender antivirus. I uninstall McAfee antivirus and using Defender as don't like trial products. This Laptop comes with MSOffice Home that's good. Laptop charger is good as its a fast charger. No lag observed till now due to heat issue and thats great from lenovo. Laptop comes with 1 year warranty where while registration on Lenevo website option to extend warranty is there but need to pay around 3 thousand for 1 year extra. Fingerprint sensor is awesome without lag.  NOTE: Laptop has total 2 USB ports compared to mentioned 3. I will write review for seller for this separately.  Overall within 68K 16 GB RAM and 500 GB SSD is not a bad deal from brand like Lenevo. If you are planning to buy Laptop for professional work only then must go for it."

Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"An honest opinion after a month of usage!  Pros: This one's really fast y'all!!! It's very very snappy!! It's not really a gaming laptop but yeah I played COD warzone, GTA V without much problems. But if you're a businessman or a developer, This laptop is for you. It's light, charges supremely fast! 0-100 in less than an hour. The camera's good too, I don't know why people complained about the webcam, Cuz I found it gr8. The brightness is well calibrated for both inside and outside, The anti-glare is well made. You'll fall in love with It's display and with it's keyboard for sure. I loved them. Really looks like a modern laptop.  Cons: I found the review of the 'battery' about this laptop to be misleading. The battery backup is mentioned 12 hrs. But to be honest, It just gives you roughly 4-5 hrs of backup on a continuous usage with medium brightness and no background apps running. It's not that bad, Cuz it charges really fast but battery should've been better.  Important: And yeah! In first few days, You might feel the laptop gets really hot, But after updating the microsoft firmware updates, That'll be fixed. That in-fact will improve the battery life too, Somewhat. Don't get me wrong, It doesn't overheat at all."
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"Yes! It's g8 for coding. I bought this for 68k inr. Writing this after using it for more than 2 months. Good specs for this price especially 16 gb ram and amd 5700u great for any sort of development and installing linux, very easy change bios settings and new bios menu is also very g8. Some things to note 1. Build quality is flimsy, I here creaking noises everytime I open the lid. 2. There are only 2 usb 3.1 ports!? 3. Backlight bleed is more than what I would say is normal, still it's not that noticeable. 4. RAM is soldered to the motherboard, 16 gigs is good for now but you may have to buy a new laptop if you ever need more than this. 5. Opening this laptop is difficult, even after removing screws on the back you need to unclip all clips before you can open the back. 6. Screen is bright and visible in sunlight, aspect ratio is 16:9 though, I would have liked it even more if had used some taller aspect ratios like 16:10, like on their new gaming line-up.  At this price point it's decent, if you can buy this with a replacement and using Amazon credit card you can get this for even better price."

Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,The only rival for Lenovo IdeaPad 5 currently is the Asus Vivobook series. I got this laptop at 67k which made this deal even better. In terms of performance this laptop hasn't given any problem as of yet(1 month) and the boot up time is on par. The only place where lenovo has compromised is the build quality. The body could have been completely metal body like HP laptops but even then the laptop looks premium
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Feature-loaded laptop in absolutely competitive price range. Ryzen 7 5700 processor is newer and best suited for slim/light-weight laptops with its 1.8GHz base clock but can be tuned upto 4Ghz for heavy usage (not recommended for overall health of device). If you wonder why not better defaults provided in factory, answer is - this machine is not designed for heavy gaming. Any more speed would put on pressure on battery and cooling system. In regular use, you cannot have better battery backup anywhere in this segment. 16 gb RAM gives support to inbuild graphics card by sharing it's ~3 gb. Around 12 gb will be usable. So if you are getting any 8gb RAM with Nvidia 4Gb dedicated card, then you can go for that as well and mostly that will be better suited from gaming perspective. Only concern for which I returned my laptop was due to screen display defect (greenish patch as shown in pic) and I must appreciate Amazon support who facilitated my return/rufund without any hassles  Other than than absolutely ""Makkhan (butter) like smooth in display while playing videos and no lag in multiporcessing/multi-tasking. I would recommend this laptop for extreme use (IT coding, VM/VDI + raw video editing + lil bit of gaming as well.)  Display: 4.5⭐/5 Processor: 4⭐/5 Performance: 4⭐/5 Battey: 5⭐/5 Build quality: 4⭐/5 If we get some similar model with additional RAM slot and extrenal graphics card, that would be a real beast.  Side note: Laptop price is keep on increasing as I observed over last 2 weeks. In electronics showroom, they are giving it for 65k with HDFC 5% additional discount. So effectively, you can use that discount to add 3 years accidental damage cover with 3 yrs Lenovo care warranty in 2500 bucks. Total amount will be INR 67500. I Checked it from a local showroom after returning my laptop to Amazon."

Also, the available RAM is 14GB since 2 Gb is reserved for graphics card Boot time is pretty fast. Build is good though it's a finger print magnet. Typing is a good experience. Fingerprint recognition is responsive & accurate. Not played any games, hence cannot comment on it."
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,Value for Money. In this price the laptop perform well. Good boot speed and processing speed. Yet to review graphics performance but with 2GB dedicated graphics it should work. Backlit keyboard is good. First impression is value for money. Will post another review in six months.

Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"For 68k, after 3 days use, its good for normal use watching vedios, web browsing. Good screen quality, battery backup of around 10hrs.

Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,This laptop cant have iris xe graphics because they are integrated graphics that come with intel 11th gen chips. Amd chips come with radeon vega integrated graphics. Also the seller mentions this laptop to have OLED display which is not true.

Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"The laptop was delivered to me on 04-09-2021. Its display is yellowish and dull. I have uploaded a picture of its display compared with lenovo S540 laptop. I checked all the settings like night mode, colour calibration, advanced display settings etc. but nothing changed. Its clearly visible that screen is defective when I call in customer care, they say that it is not an issue and have denied to replace the laptop. I also applied for an on-site visit from company, but no reply have been given to me so far after 4 days of complain. There is no service center of lenovo also in my city while on their website, they show that they have a service center, I went on the given locations and nearby shops told that it has been closed for years now. After spending 70000 rupees, I can't even get an on-site visit from company. I went to repair shop and they said that the screen is totally defective and needs to be replaced. Never buy a laptop from lenovo, Their customer care services and warranty are totally worthless."
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,Ryzen 7 5000U series..🔥🔥🔥🔥 AMD Radeon Graphics..🔥🔥🔥🔥 Rapid charger Good antiglare Battery will update later Very fast fingers print sensor Privacy shutter for camera..👍
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,Nice............ Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,The seller is selling mandatory accessories separately. Why's that so? Very peculiar to charge separately for accessories. Haven't seen anything like this anywhere
Lenovo-Graphics-Fingerprint-Aluminium-82LN00A3IN,laptop,"Good laptop for work. Has a good processor Ryzen 7 and 16 gigs of RAM and good battery backup, which is more than enough for work related stuff. Can do casual gaming, but it's not a gaming laptop. Been using this for a few months now and no complaints. I feel this is the best laptop you can buy for this price range, for now.  If you're very much into gaming as well, you can go for the lenovo Ryzen 7 4800h model. Thats definitely a better laptop in terms for the processor and graphics at the same price too. So why did I go for this? Well, thats slightly heavier as all gaming laptops are. The battery backup is lesser and it has only 8 gb of RAM.  So it all comes down to your priorities. If you don't plan to travel much with the laptop and will only use it for work stuff go for this one. Else go for the 4800h one."
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,After so many research finally planned to purchase this.As it's a new launched laptop can't get enough reviews but beleiving on the spec planned to purchase.My beleif not went wrong.Its works amazing.Though I put review on one day as per that it's awesome.Bootup is very faster as it has SSD.Also had confusion over intel and AMD.But trust me AMD Ryzen 5500 performs very good much faster than Intel i5.Sound quality is also decent. Cons: Only con I could see is camera.I willnot say it's poor but it's okay average performance.
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,"After using the ASUS VivoBook Ultra K15 (2021) - Hearty Gold variant for more than two weeks now, I am writing this product review. I bought the same on 25th August 2021 for Rs. 60,999.  Pros: Build quality is good. Multi-tasking is its strength. Weighs very light. Can work for longer hours at the same speed and performance. The battery lasts for 6 hours max which is pretty decent, I say. The camera is also decent for virtual meetings. Speaker sound and quality are on the expected lines. The fingerprint is also working fine. The typing experience is exceptional.  Cons: Delivery was made inconvenient by the seller. Had to replace the laptop only after a quarrel. Graphics is not that good. The colors and display don't look natural. The letters printed on the keyboard are the main drawback. It is very difficult to identify the letters when the backlight is on. The keys should have been given in black for a seamless typing experience.  Bottom line: Overall a good laptop with great specs in this price range. If you are a student/employee I would strongly recommend this. But for gaming and other jobs related to display, I won't. ASUS should look to improve its keyboard color design without being stingy (The Indie black variant was priced at Rs. 1000 higher than the other two variants on the date when I bought the laptop)."
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,There's already a review with pros and cons of this product. I would like to add that the backlit keyboard is nice unlike written in that review. The enter key being yellow is kinda weird. But overall the laptop is too good. It's sexy and since it has ssd it is too smooth to work on. Camera is okayish. Sensor works nicely. Over-all a nice laptop.
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,You won't regret just buy it.
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,Only brightness must be more. Performance of laptop is good.
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,"The lap colour is so good I Luv it. Battery good, not the best, Screen nice but I have supr amoled moblie so im preferring use moblie over all supr. if u can get under 58k dis is the best 😎"

ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,It's a bad choice to purchase anything from asus. No product last for more then a year. I am saying with my personal experience
ASUS-VivoBook-15-6-inch-Integrated-KM513UA-BQ513TS,laptop,"Purchased for my regular home use and for my kid's SFH (School from Home); So far good going, face no problem. - Sold by Appario Retail Private Ltd with 1yr additional extended warranty from TPS - Installed the latest updates for OS & Office - office registration with lifetime validity - no issues or slowness after upgrade - fingerprint scanner works well - The keyboard has good key travel, though backlit is not required during daylight or night light; it is useful in a completely dark room only - the laptop is not heavy at all - ultra-thin and light - has provision to upgrade RAM & SSD - will do HW upgrade definitely after 3 months and let you know."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Received my HP laptop yesterday. Its intel i5 and cost me 46,990 rupees.  Literally shocked to see the quality of the laptop and it looks like its a duplicate one.  Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic and they said they are not responsible for the quality and cannot do anything.  Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.  They are only good enough for groceries and small items.  I will stick to Flipkart for any high value items in future.  Will update the photos of the product I received shortly. Mostly I am going to throw it away."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Honest review after 5 days of usage. If you have to write a lot but you do not require a numpad (if you're not an accountant/involved with numbers) then having a properly centered keyboard with a 14"" screen is ideal if you have to often carry your laptop around (maybe at school or college)  I have bought the i5 + 8 GB RAM with Office 2019 version  Pros: 1. Crisp keys. Great typing experience.  2. It came with pre-installed office 2019 and windows 10 home.  3. Pretty good battery. The battery optimization scroll function which lets you balance battery life and performance is very helpful.  4. Great touchpad with multiple gesture functions, some of which are like Macbook's. You can switch between apps using 3 finger swipes. You can go back to desktop from anywhere with downwards 3 finger swipe. You can go to tabs view with upwards 3 finger swipe. You can open notification panel with 4 finger tap. You can even enable horizontal and vertical scroll for the touchpad. It will work on the touchpad borders once you turn it on. The touchpad settings software is a must to customize and makes working much faster.  5. Dark mode is great and works universally.  6. Light weight and can easily be carried around using a single hand.  7. Additional slot for SSD expansion. You can make it hybrid storage.  8. Great color and screen contrast.  9. Almost every element of the system is highly customizable and that's great.  Cons :  1. It is already thin, but with its weight and size, it could be thinner.  2. You cannot change your username under C:/users if you while logging in for the first time logged in with Microsoft account. If you do that, Microsoft will take the first 5 letters of your email and make it your permanent username. You won't be able to change that. I'd suggest initially logging in without logging into anything and just skip the option. That way you can change your own username. I had reset the whole computer because it was annoying. I don't know why Microsoft can't fix something so small.  3. No anti-glare screen. If a light reflection is there you just gotta increase the brightness 🤷🏼‍♂️  4. The bezels could've been thinner.  5. Doesn't come with a bag.  It's not the laptop that sucks in any way. It's Microsoft windows, the most mainstream OS of the world that sucks. Windows 10 certainly has a much larger scope of customization compared to previous windows.  This laptop is built more for professional usage but you can easily run mid tier games. However if you're looking more towards gaming and less towards MS office, you can get a laptop in SAME PRICE RANGE with nvidia graphics but then you probably won't get office.  Overall, the pros overweigh the cons. This is probably the best 14"" laptop between 40-50k. If your budget is near 50k, put 2 thousand more and buy that HP 14 with the same features + 256 GB SSD and silver colour. BUT if your budget is less than that, You probably won't find a better option with office 2019 lifetime validity.  Must buy if you're involved in typing a lot of professional stuff since it has pretty well laid out keyboard with preloaded office.  Do like if you found this useful. Feel free to ask any questions!!"
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Re reviewing : after 2 months usage The screen has a horizontal line now. Was told that it needs replacement . Service guy came after almost a week and replaced it since it was just two months . Seriously ? Just two months and the screeners spoilt. Big mistake . Should have opted for dell .  To begin with , POWER switch is a joke. Needs to be upgraded. Not sure How many months it will last Speed is slow. . Keypad and mouse pad are Good Battery is decent Screen is ok. Not bad . Weight wise it 8s superb . Compact and apperars solid. After 1 year: The body just comes apart. Use is minimal with gentle care . How does the plastic keyboard body just come off ? HP really needs to improve thier quality ."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,i am surprise that in the discription screen it was written with MS office i was disappointed when i saw its a 30 days trial software ...now my daughter is in a fix tht wht will happen after 30 we have buy MS office seprately ... totally disappointed by Amazon for the first time in life..
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"The laptop is too sluggish, even when running a simple app. Though it has 11th gen Intel CPU, 8 GB RAM, and 2 GB graphic RAM, it is much slower than my 2014 Macbook Pro. The screen resolution is bad even though it's FHD. Would not recommend anyone to buy this item."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,Happy with the product
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"This is a worse one, there are many issues in it 1. WIFI disconning automatically 2. Very low performance 3. sometimes power button doesn't working, this is due to worse button design 4. Taking more time to login page after press the power button. 5. Packing was alsonot good.  My suggestion is, please don't go to buy this product."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"After using 3 months...  This Laptop is not even worth of single star.  Very slow slow even if I working on MS Office, it stuck for a min for simple task.  I don't know which type of processor they used in this laptop, my old laptop Core 2 Duo is much faster than this i5.  It requires 4 min for bootup.  Battery discharge in 2 hours.  Heat like a frying pan.  Display quility is not up to mark.  I really vested my 60k for buying this sh**t.  I am strongly not recommended to buy this junk."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Pros:Extraordinary battery life which is lasting about 7 hrs, butter smooth keypad and lightweight. Cons: It's not Full HD, it's HD ready display with lower resolution. Installation problems with attached printer and scanner is big issue as downloaded online drivers are older and not compatible with windows 10. Need a lot of ""jugar"" to install the printer and scanner with this PC. If you call customer care they tell you like this"" though your PC is in the warranty but attachable auxiliary devices are not in the warranty or it is not there responsibly of other companies scanner like cannon"" and send you to local HP Customer Care with chargeable module of Rs. 800/-. So, this is completely unethical."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,Screen doesn't works.. The quality is not good. It is the worst product i had ever bought. Totally disappointed with this product. Please refund this. Display doesn't works. Bad name for HP company
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Don't even think of buying this product. I bought it on EMI, 39990 rs. It's very slow.. It takes 10 minutes to start. I am trying to return it since last fifteen days, and get my money back. So, that I can buy another one. But every day the coustmer executive says it will be done within two days for sure but I don't know what is wrong with amazon it could not done even after fifteen days. They are getting interest from this money and deliberately trying to postpone it. I could have given - 🌟 if was possible. Battery life is OK. To buy it is total waste of money, time and energy. Only good thing about this product is that it is light weight and looks good."

HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"My review after almost one and a half years of use. I have bought this laptop (8GB,1TB, 5th Gen) in 2019's Great Indian Festival for ₹38000. This is not perfect for me. As a engineer student, I use heavy softwares like SOLIDWORKS and MATLAB, and this laptop becomes so slow if any one of them are being used. But, for ₹38000 this is a value for money and is very useful for those students who don't have to use heavy softwares on this. This is nice laptop for students as they can't play heavy and good games on this laptop even they want to😂."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,Delivered opened box... System model not specified exactly as 14q cs0017TU and processor speed not 3.9ghz its just 1.6.  After seeing all performance will edit this again.....before return date.

HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Got this HP laptop for 39990 during an Amazon Great Indian Sale in 2019. Have been using it since then and haven't faced any issues.  Pros: 1. Lightweight and Thin 2. Great specifications (i5 8th Gen, 8GB RAM, 1 TB HDD etc.) 3. Good display 4. Came pre-loaded with Windows 10 and MS Office 2019  Cons: 1. The Keyboard feels too flimsy. A little skeptical on the long term usage of this keyboard. Feels like the keys can come out at any moment. 2. The cooling vents are on the bottom of the laptop. There aren't any vents on the sides or back."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"The Day this 14 Inch HP Laptop delivered to us, It started On and Half with Airplane Mode and we are unable to use any Internet Based Services.  When called to HP Customer Care, They lift after agonising wait for several Minutes and So far, they have asked us to Change System based Software Changes lasts for 2-3 Hrs, again Problem prevailing and not solved.  Now, After paying Handsome Money, we are desperately waiting for Some Technician to come to solve the problem or Replacement of Laptop."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Laptop is light weighted because it’s body has very poor quality plastic is there in the body. Even thought it has latest processor and 8 GB RAM, my Dell laptop with 4GB and I3 is way faster than this new product. I got it with the back date warranty registered that means I got someone’s replacement piece but Amazon has nice rules that with performance issues replacement is also not possible. I am a regular buyer with Amazon but they disappointment me with purchase.  Will not recommend to buy this product."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,Worst product. Touchpad was not working and Amazon made me run diagnosis on the laptop although i told them the touchpad is not working. Made me run for 50 mile s to return the product. I know despite reading this people might go for it. But you will regret it. Trust me.
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Battery life is good. More than 5 hours for simple work like documents. Weight is light. Easy to carry. Although these days one would expect a fast startup than this, at this cost this is a valuable laptop. HP could try to make a variant with some added SSD memory and give a faster startup. This could increase the cost by 2000-3000 rupees."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Within a year display leakage started. See the dark and white spots at the bottom. When I contacted HP customer service they said it is not covered under warranty! My laptop always on the table since lockdown started and the problem appeared in this period only... Poor quality and poor customer service. They will never give you a callback, you have to call again and again to know your complaint status.. I will never buy HP again."

HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,A good purchase considering the fact that nothing comes in a perfect package. The battery life is where I could not commend as it is below my expectations. Have been using it for a month now and it is working well except some reservation on battery life.
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"The product description mentions MS Office, but its 30 days trial software. Its blatant cheating on part of the seller and amazon is also responsible for having them onboard. Total disappointment. the plastic build seems to be very ordinary and refurbished."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Don't buy any laptop from this seller, this seller isn't verify and they didn't provide laptop bag, cover also some part of laptop's motherboard was not original but luckey my pc is under warranty and motherboard got replaced by HP. Even the first laptop i received was without hard disk."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The product is in terms of performance, but the built quality.

Not satisfied with this purchase."

HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,All good except for the fact that it cannot connect to the faster wifi connection (Airtel 5G) and connects only to the slower speed network. The service engineer also confirmed the same. This is not mentioned in the specifications.
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Probably one of the best around the specified price range I would recommend to go for it. But, there's no office with lifetime validity. You'll have to install a crack from the internet or share someone's Microsoft account for accessing the complete features of the office 365 and it's applications. Battery is amazing Audio is also great All in all, if you are looking for a good laptop for work and a little bit of gaming, then this one is worth buying"
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"The laptop is really good. It has intel core i5 processor 8th generation, windows 10 lifetime. It comes with MS Office 2019 (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote) lifetime validity, you just need to activate it online. The video of how to activate is given on amazon website. The delivery was good and on time. The audio quality of the speaker is nice. It is best for students and professionals. I bought it on offer and got a really nice price for it."

HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,A very good overall performance. Battery life is quite good. Sometimes the system gets hanged and you need to wait for the laptop to respond.

HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"First of all, this is after 15 days of daily usage  Pros: 1)Windows 10 OS is pre-installed with Microsoft office, Which is great to use. 2)No heating issues or heavy fan sounds so far 3)Core i5 8th Gen is no doubt faster, Compare to core i3 I have used previously. Also, its 8265U which goes up to 3.9ghz. Better than most i5 you see online. 4)build quality is good. 5)The touchpad is good and as per expectation, so is the keyboard. 6)extremely Light weight and its the best thing about this laptop.  Cons: 1)Battery life is not as per given 7 hours, it is hardly 5 to 6 hours 2)Not a full HD display as might expect, but its more than enough for media consumption and daily productivity or coding etc. Also, it has anti-glare feature which is a plus point  Overall, go for this laptop if you are using your laptop in the evening or somewhere around 5 to 6 hours, will not recommend for official work or heavy gaming."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,Dont buy this laptop it is waste product Drawbacks : 1. Overheating 2. Hanging 3.Charge fast dry 4. During charge it will take more hours to full 5. Auto restart 6. No backlite keyboard 7. No ssd

I can play really high end games as smooth as ever. 3) I am using this laptop from 2 weeks so far and it is beautiful. And really, amazon delivered it on time & safely. Now I can work more efficiently, thank you!!"
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"To be very honeat,hp laptops are worthless if you go for like under rs 45000 Their physical build doesn't meet expectation, I would suggest everyone to buy dell, i had 14inch dell laptop that lasted for like 7years and then sold it. I bought hp 15r245tx and it's been repaired around 3times for its hinges, display and now its mouse buttons.but now going to buy dell. You pay bit more but u get more than that else that extra paid money for dell goes in repair of hp laptops."

TB HDD an 256 GB SSD Gaming Machine. it has a promising pair of powerful cooling fans,a huge 15.6 inch screen and Graphics that are jawdropping. As I got it for 66K, I think it is a must buy product, but I will recommend to buy a mouse for a better gaming experience."
HP-15-6-inch-Laptop-Graphics-15s-du3060TX,laptop,"Slow a shtik , better not to take this model. A better one would be the hp 15s series laptop with 1tb hdd and 256 ssd or 128 ssd. The suggested one might be just a little high by 2k - 5k extra , but rather to spend a little extra than regret taking this. Also the battery does not last longer than 2 hrs always have to take the charger whenever you go out for work 😩.  Main prblms 1.slow as shtik 2.one full charge lasts for only 2 to 3 hrs 3.no back lit keyboard to use in the dark 4.the screen is so thin that it feels , that it would rip off from the pc any time 5.it has so many holes that insects might get into it due to the electro magnetic waves emissions, which happens to have been experienced by me . In my case the insects were red ants .  Hence i would notsuggest this to anyone . Rather spend a little extra 3k to 5k to buy a laptop with sdd and hdd (both included) along with a back lit keyboard.  Hope this helps you 🤗"

Now my order status shows, that I am the one who refused to take. I also asked, if it is possible for me to pay balance amount by other methods, at least let me have laptop, to which i was simply refused. This was truly a bad experience for me.

ASUS-VivoBook14-Integrated-14-1-inch-M415DA-EB502TS,laptop,Writing feedback after using for a week apart from given configuration/specifications. I bought this for my office work and online classes.  Pros: 1. 4-5 hours battery backup. 2. Shutdown and start in 20 - 30 sec. 3. Screen is wide and clear. 4. Extra slot for ssd. 5. Light weight for sure. 6. Good and study outer material. 7. Touchpad is very good.  Cons: 1. Restart is taking almost 2.5 - 3 min 2. Webcam is ok only. Can be enhanced. 3. No backlite. 4. Speaker sound is low but good while using headphone.
ASUS-VivoBook14-Integrated-14-1-inch-M415DA-EB502TS,laptop,For gaming ...waste Battery life poot Brightness is good
ASUS-VivoBook14-Integrated-14-1-inch-M415DA-EB502TS,laptop,The laptop is the slowest despite having an 8 gb RAM and the MS office installed is bogus. THE MS LICENSE EXPIRED IN 1.5 MONTHS WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR 3 MONTHS. Please do not buy it! Waste of money.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"A video-audio desync issue is going on with this series of laptops and I am a victim of it. I found it online that almost 80% of the products of this series has this issue and Lenovo is not finding a fix or any sort of driver or software update for it. As I found this issue quite late, I am not able to replace it. As the only solution now is to fix it, I have been in contact with Lenovo support team for few days now, and they don't seem to understand the issue or find a proper solution for it. Buying a 65K+ laptop and not being able to watch even a video properly is a pathetic condition."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"I am a Data Scientist, I brought this for my personal project work and gamming. The product is not good, Model design causes too much Heating issues.  But if you upgrade your total RAM to either 24GB or 32GB then the performance becomes great. And you should use a powerful cooling pad along with it.  One more suggestion for Lenovo, if you provide the 512GB SSD along with 1TB HDD, then the load balancing will be fantastic."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"I bought this laptop 1 month ago and after 1 month the SSD crashed. I called Lenevo customer care, they sent their HW guy who only changed the SSD which was the partial fix. I am calling them from past 2 weeks and they are just delaying the repair."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,I am not a pro reviewer as such. But will try to list what I found good or bad about this laptop when comparing with my older laptop.  Pros: 1. Good screen. But would recommend 144hz panel 2. Boot up happens in a jiffy as os is installed in ssd 3. Cooling performance is good 4. Gaming performance for entry level is good  Cons: 1. This is the most annoying thing I found on this laptop. The keyboard. It has home and end keys in arrow keys which we need to combo it with funtion key. Not so practical. 2. Nose cam is straight up annoying 3. Forget that you have speakers in this better to pair this with a Bluetooth speaker 4. Expecting gtx 1650ti at this price point  Its not a bad laptop as such but the cons of this made this a bad purchase for me
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"TLDR: Great laptop. Can be your daily driver. Needs more RAM if you are using Adobe applications. Packaging was a total fail by Amazon(see pic). The processor I got was 8th gen even though they advertised 9th gen literally everywhere.  On the processor: I have taken a screenshot of CPUZ which shows the processor architecture to be 8th gen(Kaby Lake). Lenovo has advertised 9th gen(Coffee Lake architecture) I want someone from Lenovo to contact me on this.  I did a little research on this before my purchase. It seemed like the perfect laptop to go for that came in a good budget. It is made very well and feels good to hold. It really isnt that heavy at 2.3kgs and it can definitely be your long-term workhorse.  A few things:  The Screen: There is an option to go for the 140Hz screen but that would only be for extreme gaming use or if you worked extensively with color(especially color correction). Most of the buying public would want to go for the 60Hz screen as it is a fantastic screen that wouldn't burden the small battery that the Legion comes with.  The Keyboard: Pretty fantastic actually. It has good spacing between keys and there is good travel to each click. There is a great dampening effect for comfortable typing and gives you assurance that the key has been pressed. Good back lighting on the keyboard although the brightness needs to be changed manually. Not a problem at all. The white backlight makes it a bit subdued and comfortable so you can carry this around everywhere without looking like a 16 year old with RGB lighting. I thought the number pad on the right would be a bother but it is actually pretty usable and I have started using it a lot. The arrow keys are placed very well and are a pleasure to use. If you are a fan of racing games this would be great.  The Trackpad: I have been using Macs for 12 years and that trackpad has spoiled me greatly. It is the greatest piece of engineering. I thought I would hate all trackpads on Windows machines(I have a Dell XPS 15 9570 as well and I just hate the stupid trackpad on it). The Legion surprised me. You don't need a mouse with this thing. The button clicks are a bit hard but it that is just fine in my opinion. There are gesture controls with 2 and 3 fingers that work as intended. Overall just great!  Battery Life: This is something that needs to be talked about a bit more by Lenovo and I couldn't find it anywhere other than Amazon reviews. There is a difference between the 81SY00SNIN and 81SY00B6IN models of the Legion and that is basically the i5 processor. The 81SY00B6IN(this model) has the i5 9300H and the 81SY00SNIN has the i5 9300HF. The ""HF"" model doesnt have Intel's on board graphics processing unit and so you cannot enable ""Hybrid Mode""(when you arent running games or heavy graphics intensive apps the systems runs of Intels UHD graphics and saves a ton of battery.) If you get the 81SY00SNIN your battery will run out much faster. Lenovo Vantage software not only lets you run Hybrid Mode and save battery, it has a Conservation Mode that only lets your battery charge to 60% while plugged in. This reduced the impact on the battery per charge cycle and lets your battery last much longer. The smaller battery(52Wh) lasts for about 4 - 5 hour during standard use. But this, I have felt, is just fine because the fast charging brick charges your laptop from 0 - 100 in no time. If you are gaming make sure you are plugged in.  RAM and RAM Slots: The onboard ram is 2666Mhz 8GB. It uses just one socket which is great so you can just buy a similar 8Gb RAM chip and plug it in. Most laptops use 2X4GB RAM chips to give you 8GB and in that case, for an upgrade to 16GB RAM you would have to buy 2X8GB RAM chips. Well thought out. For most games 8Gb of RAM is just fine. If you are working on After Effects and Premiere Pro I suggest you get another 8Gb RAM chip. I have worked with Crucial before and it is a good company to buy storage products. This is a good RAM that should go with your machine - Crucial CT8G4SFS8266 8GB DDR4 PC4-21300 CL-19 2666 MT/s SODIMM RAM  CPU: As mentioned initially, I seem to have got a ""Kaby Lake"" processor that seems to be Intel's 8th gen model. Lenovo has mentioned 9th gen in all their marketing. 9th gen processors are ""Coffee lake"". This seems to be a huge oversight on their part. That said, the CPU is blazing and handles anything you through at it. I game and work on After Effects and Premiere Pro among other Adobe applications. I have never felt it lacking in anything.  Camera: The camera is nonsense. It is grainy and aimed right up your nose because it is placed under the screen. But I dont think you would care about it too much when video calling. Just aim the screen correctly and you should be good to go. The mics are not great but they get the job done.  Speakers: Again, I have been using Macs for more than a decade and they all have great speakers. I was a little apprehensive about the speakers as most manufacturers don't pay much attention to them. My Dell XPS 9570 has speakers that pure rubbish. This Legion surprised me. The speakers are actually quite good. Good volume to watch movies or game. They are pretty clear. They lack bass in my opinion but that is just my opinion.  Cooling and Fan Noise: There is really no noise from the system at idle. When it starts heating up under load there is some noise but it really isn't something to even complain about.  All in all I love this laptop. I have been a heavy computer user for many many years now and this could be my daily driver for many years."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,Works as expected. Good battery. The screen needs a bit more nits. Heats up if you game more than an hour. Not much noise when normal use. Battery side heating is a bit uncomformtable. Keypad is ok. Backlit is nice but unicolour. The laptop monitor lid gets loose easily. Also flexes . Nice minimal look. Can double up for office use and a bit side gaming. Nose cam location makes you look a bit funny :) Thats all. Go for it...one of the best in this price category. Allrounder.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,Awesome gaming experience but high end game need dissolves your juice very fast and you have to plug charger and play Rest product quality is good and value for money I bought this for Rs 69990 /- and with 9 months of EMI it went to Rs 74000 /- Battery is good if you are into working stuff but while gaming with 100 % charge you may play up till 1 hour after you need to plug the adapter
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,Received a damaged product. Screen was damaged. I am still waiting on the replacement
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,This laptop is like a beast for gaming ....u can play every game smoothly without a doubt...this is something gamers who play on laptops need....but everything has cons as well....i only encounter 2 cons :- 1) Cold front is good but they need to give small rubber stands or feet to lift the laptop a little up from back for coldfront to use properly....i cant find any suitable rubber feet or stand on Amazon nd even in lenovo store....  2) Instead of 60hz they should have give 90 or 144 hz screen....  60 hz is enough for 90% of games ...but 90 or 144hz give a little option that the hz will always be abv 60 or remain at 60 not less...i get 55 to 60 hz but not constant 60 hz
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,I did not get my intel master key
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"Excellent!!!! Pros: 1. Display awesome 2. Build quality excellent 3. Laptop functioning is fast. Cons: 1. Audio is little bit low 2. Mouse left and right keys are bit hard to press 3. Webcam is bottom of the screen.  Till now I have not installed any games. So, I don't the performance of laptop while playing games."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"Superb Laptop. Battery backup 3 to 5 hrs depending on battery saver and screen brightness. Able to play games with higher frame rate. For Software Development, Eclipse performs superb. instant response.  Only problem is warranty. I got only 9 months warranty even if i bought it in June(Calculated from March). Apart from this warranty problem everything is superb."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,i bought this laptop for about 60k it was 4gb 1650 gtx 1 tb hdd + 256 gb ssd i am reviewing this laptop after exactly 1 year when first had this laptop i had a audio video desync i called the lenovo support within 2 days they came to my place with a new ssd samsung company and they just changed my ssd from MZ something to samsung and after that my laptop worked perfectly fine i also did a very high gaming it was perfect i loved it.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"First of if you want a prolonged battery life,dont buy it. This is beast of a gaming laptop,1650gtx+256ssd-i5-9th is all you could as for at 60-70k price range. But the battery life is too short,for example:if you want to even watch a movie of 2.5 hours it would drain from 100% to 25%. I have played games pretty much and put it on charge in mere 40 minutes. You need to undervolt the cpu voltage,use intel's undervolting software if it starts heating.No it wont effect performanceand enhance battery life abit. All in all Gaming:9/10 Battery:6/10 Build quality:9/10 (think of it like a plastic war tank) Looks:10/10 Screen:8/10 (60hz) Bought on October 6th 2019 for 67k"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,Warranty given for only 9 months from the date of purchase. No response from Lenovo when I sent a mail regarding extension of warranty. Or is there any other way to extend the warranty?
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"For past 10 days I am facing screen freezing, frequently system reboot. I have done OS reset but issue still persists. May be have some issues with hardwares like harddrive, RAM or maybe with mother board. Have seen similar issuess reported by other users with Legion series."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,Pros: Easy to upgrade RAM and SSD Good graphics Value for money  Cons: Battery life poor Processor does have issues while running video. Laggy.  Overall: Good value for money
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"It's cool . If you are like me and don't like the gaming laptop look and want something professional from the outside and the beast in the inside , this one is for you . Regarding the other specs , all gaming laptops have battery issues , it's upto you how you manage it . I've been there searching a lot of laptops and finally deciding on one. Trust me if you feel it's good , trust your gut rather than trying to compare even the tiniest bits with other laptops . Also I got it for 69.9k so nice👌"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"When i bought this lap, i was a bit unsure about it since ite was lenovo.... But it turned out to be a good choice. In terms of performance, it can handle any games thrown. The game with highest graphoc setting i played was AC Odyessey, and the gameplay was smooth. A full charge battery can last upto 6 hours provided it is not in conservation mode. In terms of looks, it is a gaming laptop with a professional touch ( can easily trick anyone).  If you hve the budget go for it, if you can spend more, then go for the i9 configuration."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,"I have received this laptop today impressed with the first looks, I will surely edit this review after 3 months and then after 6 months again. I have tried games such as csgo,cs1.6 and much more to be set up. Will surely update my review"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UAIN,laptop,Worst laptop I have ever seen within one n half month of purchase i went to service center because of mother board problem. Please don't buy this laptop. Don't go for lenovo laptops.

Every other day it's drivers go haywire. Doesn't read my mouse, doesn't read my external keyboard, midi keyboard, external soundcard. And not it's own keyboard has stopped working all of a sudden, and I've cleaned it, updated everything in it but no result.  For gaming,.. aahh..play a game in this laptop and the fans will be as quiet as pin drop silence, and then open ms word and the fans go zzzoooommmm, as if I've opened 100 instances of the most heaviest games ever.  Battery life is disgusting. Doesn't even give an hour of backup, and that too on standby. Can't do anything without keeping it connected.  I just want to punch it on the screen and blow it up but I can't because mine is not even a year old. What should i do.  Just don't buy this laptop, or buy this laptop if you want to kill any productivity you have. Thank you Lenovo for making my life worse with this 60k piece of junk"

So don't worry :) 2) Next when u first setup the laptop it would ask you about your Dropbox credentials, Lenovo is giving 30gb free cloud storage for an year. So make sure you create a new Dropbox account at that time itself and don't login with your previous Dropbox credentials to avail 30gb cloud storage."

Performance is great did some photo editing using Photoshop and Lightroom.  Battery backup is a plus over acer again.  Cons: No windows hello Screen is not bright enough to use in brightly lit area Sharp edges on hand rest area  Will update my review again after loading fews games on it."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,1) unexpected 'kernel power 41 error' power loss - 8 times in the first 48 hours - narrowed down to hdmi o/p - NO outages if hdmi is not used testing with 'usb-c to display port cable' to narrow down the trigger. WIll update the review in future <18 AUG update> 'usb-c to display port cable' doesnt trigger any more power outages but my son stopped external monitor ( LG 21: 9 UltraWide 25UM65) as the laptop screen better/smoother results during gameplay  2) power on button should have been side facing rather than on keyboard. - would helped in powering on without opening the lid while using external monitor  3) external devices like - usb keyboard to enter into bios - hdmi monitor to see bios messages cannot be used during initial power on. They work only after windows load  4) bios doesnt have scheduled power on options

HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The outlook seems to good but as the finish is kind of matte finger prints are smudged in the outer cases and the display hinge is built with less quality. It's wobbling with air from the fan . Charging seems to be faster with the 200w charger and all the required ports are provided in the lap. Need to test the laptop with multi tasking and gaming to provide detailed review on the performance. Display resolution is good with 60 hz when comparing other laptops. Speakers are not providing very good sound experience but sound quality is ok.
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"A mixed bag. But truly a beast within this beauty if you go by specs alone. This machine has technical capabilities, its the execution that makes you want a bit more quality.  Pros  1. Once you get everything up and running it’s fairly smooth sailing. 2. The colour is nice and it doesn’t scream gaming computer, though the texture is an oil magnet. Design could have been smoother edged. But no real complaints. 3. I just love the fact that MS Office is bundled in the price people! Why have we had to wait so long for this to become a reality. I don’t know if we get to keep this if we upgrade to Windows 11 though. 4. Love the compact power bric, that has been carried over from the earlier Pavillion gaming series. 5. At face value and looking at some videos I think this is going to be easier to pop open and upgrade. Compared to the slimmer Pavillion line. 6. Nice large touchpad with a tangible click. Didn’t rattle for me. 7. While I would have loved full up and down arrow keys the tradition inverted T layout makes it better to use. 8. Sound is fine for basic use, but I expect most will connect it to a Bluetooth speaker.  Cons 1. The initial setup was kind of painful. I’ve never had this issue with Windows 10 before. It forced me to sign in with an Outlook account. There was no option to skip this for an offline account because I had already setup the wifi. It would hang at this step. After repeat attempts turning it off, I finally I disconnected my wifi router and was then able to set it up offline. One of the reasons for this is I think the laptop starts updating immediately in the background which interferes with the setup process. It was then I realized there is no airplane mode button to toggle off the wifi. 2. The power button - I have no clue what rhyme or reason lead them to include that in the top row of function keys. I do know that it probably wasn’t the wisest to keep it next to the delete key – which everyone is going to be using. So let’s say someone accidentally hits power instead of the delete button? Luckily it doesn’t shutdown the PC by default. But yes if you change your power settings that’s something to look at. It is a bit sturdier than the other keyboard buttons, so am glad for that. Still like someone else pointed out, if you have so many vertical laptop stands being used, perhaps a power button on the side might make sense. Or maybe just not in line with the rest of the keys. I figured they were trying to saving money here. 3. 8GB RAM isn’t going to cut it for long. I see already a 50 – 60% utilization for normal non-gaming usage. I wish all models were 16GB by default. Though if I’m honest the more RAM you give a machine, the more it gobbles it up and you have huge paging files. My Pavillion has 32Gb. 4. Yes its true the screen wobbles to the touch. Wish we could make those hinges stronger. How did HP overlook this. The worst is, if you are a hard-hitting typist, this isn’t going to be for you because the vibration is going to transfer and jolt the screen. Takes some time to get used to the uneven bezels. 5. This is slightly shorter in width than my HP Pavilion Power Laptop 15-cb0xx. That laptop had f12 slaved to Airplane mode, this one seems to have a dedicated button to lock the windows button. Not sure what purpose it serves. 6. Personally would have liked to see some HP branding on the machine too. But at least the V is a lot more subtle than the mirror dime HP logo. 7. Not sure how strong the vent at the bottom is going to be, it looks delicate, considering this is an all plastic build. 8. Fair amount of bloatware to be uninstalled. 9. The keyboard is a little different to touch from the standard HP keyboards I've used in the past. Will take some getting used too.  I didn’t have any problems with the HDMI, like some other people have had. However, do note that the HDMI port is on the left of the machine. Which is a bit of a pain if you keep your laptop to your left and have a main monitor to your right, you’ll need to do some cable management. I didn’t realize such a simple thing would make such a difference. Haven’t tested the audio out port yet, but since it’s a plastic body I don’t think it will have the buzz problem metal bodied pavilions give headphones.  Overall no regrets, except for the RAM. Go ahead and buy it, I believe it retails cheaper on Amazon than in -store.  Bit difficult to get a carry case for this size."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Great laptop at this cost. All the specs justify the price and are suitable for all purposes such as gaming, video editing, graphics designing etc.  Pros: * Though the screen is 16.1 inch the laptop is not too big to carry. * Battery life is around 4-5 hours at normal usage. * Keyboard is too good and is comfortable while typing. * Huge Touchpad. * Great thermal design. * very less keyboard flex and sturdy design. * Speakers are great  Cons: * A slight wobbly top lid but not that troublesome. * Storage is not sufficient (nothing to do, bcz other variants are not available) * No privacy shutter * The ports are too tight (maybe bcz its new)  Hope this helps :)"

Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Very slow processing please don't buy it.
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"First off, the price to performance ratio on this thing is just amazing. The display, the contrast ratio on the display is too good to be true on an IPS panel. Keyboard feels good, adequately placed keys.  Now moving on to the cons, the biggest con you will notice is the plastic, but for the price point and the power it packs I understand HP had to cut some corners. Then comes the battery life, it does give you a decent battery life but, come on it ain't no m1 macbook level battery life, for a gaming laptop the battery life is decent but on a more general scale it falls under the below average scale in battery life. Bloatware, this laptop comes with a hello of a lot of bloatware and on top of windows 10's telemetry HP also wants to analyse your usage data.  Personally, I wiped the whole drive and reinstalled windows fresh and ran a couple of debloat scripts for windows 10 by Chris Titus Tech and WinRice from GitHub. After reinstalling windows and removing bloat the ram usage went down significantly from 47% on the stock laptop vs 30% on debloated one. You can always download the Omen software from HP's website if that is what you're worried about. Wifi stopped working after reinstalling windows but I easily found the LAN drivers from HP's website.  I tested out a few games myself, keep in mind the screen is 60hz so anything beyond 60 fps wouldn't matter and most games I tested, like No Man's Sky, Hitman 2, Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Genshin Impact ran pretty much at high settings at 60 fps at 1080p without any noticeable frame drops.  4/5 Will recommend the laptop for people who are into gaming. This laptop for me is a keeper."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"** Please read the complete review before making any decisions  Initial impressions were great. The build quality is pretty good the only exception is the hinge. The matte finish looks good but is a finger print magnet. Now coming to the screen, its a 16.1 inch 60Hz screen with 250 nits of brightness which is pretty decent tbh, you won't notice any difference if you haven't used any high end screens before. The keyboard is really great, typing on it feels really good. You also get a numpad which is a plus if you do excel or any data entry. The keyboard is back lit (white- single colour), the brightness of the back light cannot be adjusted which is not that much of an issue. The trackpad is huge and is precise to use, the surface of the trackpad is plastic but overall the trackpad is good. The keyboard deck is sturdy, doesn't flex much.  Now coming to performance, I purchased the Ryzen 5 5600H and RTX 3050 model which is really great combination. No doubt the performance is just amazing. Thermals though can be a bit on high side. The vent on the bottom may look big but it is open only for the fans. While doing blender, the temp rises to 100 degrees and stays there which is honestly scary although the CPU can handle up to 105 degrees but still higher the temp stays that much bad is for the laptop in general. For video editing and VFX its is good. I used Premiere Pro and After Effects and in both the laptop didn't disappoint. Though while editing uncompressed 4K video, the scrubbing through timeline wasn't smooth which I think is some optimization issue and may be fixed in future updates. For Photoshop and Illustrator it is great. The port selection is great, you won't face any issue there. The storage though is 512GB which can be limiting sometime. I suggest using an external HDD or SSD. The battery life is descent. I get 4 hours of battery life at power saving mode of windows and quiet mode in OMEN hub and at 50% brightness. The whole time I was downloading software through WIFI and surfing internet and watching YouTube. Don't really recommend using it on battery for any gaming or production works. The laptop is heavy and is really difficult to carry, it also doesn't fit in my big American Tourister laptop bag. The customer service of HP is really great. They helped me through a WIFI connectivity issue I was facing and also helped me get my refund as amazon cancelled my return first time I did and asked me to contact HP service centre and ask for warranty and denied my return first time. The service centre guy helped me through the process. Kudos to HP customer care.  Now coming to reason I returned this laptop is the wobbling of top lid. The wobbling is really bad. Under fan(not even at the top speed) the top lid wobbles, this was the only deal breaker for me. I wish HP had designed the laptop in a better way, this laptop would've been a great choice for almost everyone in this budget segment. If you don't think that wobbling won't be an issue then go with this laptop, It is currently the best option to choose from."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Hi Samurai! Just go for it you won't be disappointed, let me explain you why... Pros: -Ryzen 5 5600H (sweet spot for gamer and professional use) -RTX3050 4GB (I know the VRAM is not sufficient for blender and all but for this price this is on par) -Display (The display is not having much bleeding issue while compared with other IPS displays) -RAM (3200Mhz of 8GB which is so fast for any tasks) -NVMe SSD (512GB of blazing storage) -Design (The design is superb and compared with Omen, I like this one don't know why like the V logo rather than Hewlett Packard) -Air Vent (The air vent is major plus in this model) -Keyboard (I'm in love with full sized and precise spacing between keys) -Trackpad (A major thing which very few companies concentrate, HP heard us this is one of the best large trackpad I seen)  Cons: -Build Quality (Let me clarify you the unit I received the wobble is not much and it depends on the unit) -Battery (The Battery is good actually but for its weight I expected bit more) -Display(60Hz only 😒for it's price fine still expected atleast 120Hz as next version would be 144Hz)  TL;DR version Just Go for it! For next 5 yrs you won't regret👌👌👌"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"I have been using this laptop from last one week.. Amazon didn't took my old laptop in exchange although they mentioned it in website. But coming to the performance of laptop The CPU and GPU are very powerful 3050 is a beast and better than 1650ti Sound quality is good Plastic quality of body is also good Screen wobble is there as mentioned in many websites, but it is not horrible. You should not try to shake the screen manually, although I found no issues while typing or gaming  AC Odyssey, Red dead redemption 2 works fine in medium to high settings. An average of 55 FPS is what you will get.  The only issue I found is , the charger is Getty heated after sometimes and the CPU temperature also goes high for some games  But throttling is not an issue even though CPU temp goes above 90 Overall a solid laptop for gaming and other tasks"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"I am writing this review after using the laptop for 2+ weeks after receiving the laptop.  The performance is impressive. Right after I turned ON the laptop for the very first time, I performed a benchmark to check where it stands and discovered that with the new Ryzen 5 5600H it absolutely thrashes shintel powered laptops in this category.  I performed Benchmark again, minutes before writing this review, the laptop performed well even with some apps running in the background.  I use apps like, Adobe Photoshop, Aftereffects and other tools meant for software engineering/development applications. The render time for videos is good. One can use all the above-mentioned tools at the same with with no lags or issues and is great for ML applications.  Pros: 1. Impressive performance with the latest Ryzen chip. 2. Good battery life: 9+ hours on light usage with wifi. 3. Good keyboard, loved the key travel, great typing experience. 4. Above average speakers 5. Impressive cooling. 6. Anti-glare display  Cons: 1. Refresh rate of the display, (okay for regular use and entertainment, maybe not for hardcore gaming) 2. Brightness can be better, not a great experience while using outdoors. 3. The hinge is a little unstable and flexes with slight movement while using on the lap."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"It's a perfect entry level gaming laptop with the latest rtx graphics. The build quality is average but its what expected at this price point. Honestly The display is much better than what i expected and has very good brightness and the anti glare performance is pretty good overall. Speakers are loud enough and the quality is quite fine, the keyboard feels quite average but again the pricing justifies it. The ssd performance is also quite good and the ryzen 5 chipset just seals the deal for me.  While pre ordering, thermals were my biggest worry but i have to say this machine has excellent thermals (good job hp). I played the witcher 3 at max settings for 4-5 hours continuously and didn't experience any noticeable frame drop or even the slightest over heating(i used the system keyboard and its not even noticeably warm). The fan noise is not too loud but not silebt either.  The biggest letdown would be the x16 ram instead of x8 and the cpaacity is only 8gb which will need to be upgraded. If you have 17k more to spend i'd advise you to get the 3050 ti version( which has ryzen 7 and 120 hz display) that being said for an extra 10 k you could upgrade the storage and ram on this laptop so whatever fits your budget i guess. The back of the laptop leaves smudge marks when you touch it( in photo) and that's also kind of disapointing.  Battery life is kinda hard to point out accurately now because i've only played the games plugged in. But from my experience you should be able to stream movies for atleast 2.5 hrs at full Hd and at max brightness and that kinda seems okay i guess.  Many people have been complaining about screen wobble and there is wobble but it's not excessive or a deal breaker. Unless you are looking specifically for the issue you won't even notice it i think.  Overall i think this product offers great value for money and for entry level to moderate gaming this is a purchase that you will not regret."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,Good laptop but problem of screen bleeding other all things are fine
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,Its the best gaming laptop under 75k. Battery life is also good. The biggest drawback is it only has 60hz display and it have a decent screen wobble. If you are okay with these then go for it.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Amazing machine. Super light and strong with gray battery life and startup time
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,I like thik product
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"One of the best laptops under ₹75000. You guys already know the specs. So i'm not covering that topic.  Display: The display is very good. Though it's just a 45% NTSC panel, the colors are good enough. The contrast is however, beautiful ❤️. It's a treat to watch movies on this laptop. Performance: So far so good. No lags at all. Boots within 10seconds. Tried a few games, ran exceptionally well. The GPU & CPU temperatures are well controlled. Though I will upgrade it to 16GB ram very soon. Photoshop works flawlessly. Also, the ssd provided inside it is a NVMe M.2 SSD. I'm getting transfer speeds over 1GB/s. One ssd slot is occupied and the other one is free so i can always get another one. Battery: Very good for a gaming laptop. I'm getting 4-5 hours on a single charge. If put on quiet mode, it may run upto 6-7 hours. Cooling: Exceptionally good. Keypad & Trackpad: One of the best laptop keyboards i've ever used. The trackpad is HUGE. It's a pleasure to work on it.  Cons: Display could've been 120Hz. Also the display wobbles a little. That doesn't affect the viewing experience though. Final verdict: Go for it until 3060 becomes cheaper. Also, for best laptop deals join @gamingsetupdeals channel on telegram. They keep posting about low price alerts and much more."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"I've been using it for sometime now and here are my thoughts  Display - Display quality is on par with the Nitros and Legions at this price. The display is okay for indoor usage unless you're sitting in an insanely bright room, coz the display doesn't get very bright and you'd have trouble. One thing I didn't like is the hinge. It wobbles and over time when the hinge loses strength, it could be a problem. But again depends on how you take care of the laptop.  Performance - Performance is really good. I only tried GTA V on very high graphics setting and easily got 60+ fps, gameplay was smooth and no hiccups anywhere. Laptop boots up in literally 2-3 seconds. Normal day to day is a breeze thanks to Ryzen 5 5600h. Fan noise is bearable, not too loud. Thermals on this device is really well done, doesn't heat up much even after extended hours of gaming (gta v).  Build Quality - There is top lid flex and very little keyboard flex. But the quality of plastic used is really good. It's not as premium feeling as Legion but better or equivalent to the Nitro series I feel. It's got a really big trackpad and you can hear the clicks when you press on it.  Battery Life - You can't really expect much battery life from a gaming laptop, I got somewhere around 2.5 -3 hours (not on battery saver mode) and I guess that's okayish.  Speakers - Speakers are loud and decent. There is distortion on high volumes. It's not as good as legion though. If you're gamer you're obviously gonna get nice headphones, so yeah. Speakers are good, not great.  SO far it's really great and i really enjoy using it. Things lacking is a higher refresh rate and higher storage options. If you can look past that go for it!"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"I like the product performance. It's superfast!! I dual booted it with latest version of Ubuntu 20.04LTS. Had to install wifi driver separately as current kernal 5.11 doesn't support the RT8825AU wifi chip.  Still, 4 stars only as Screen Wobble is horrible. I am thinking about creating a 3d printed part as a support for screen so that the hinge won't get damaged because of this wobbling issues. If you don't use fan at full speed, or use AC only, then it won't be a problem."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"HP Victus is amazing.. but i would mention some points to clear your confusion PRO's - processor(Ryzen 5 5600 H) and GPU(RTX 3050) is upto the mark -Design is not like other gaming laptops ,may be it could be a con to u but i was wanted a good performance laptop with office type look ..althoug this laptop has some touch in design but that makes it's design look nice. -keyboard typing experience is awesome. -Battery backup is really nice ..normally other gaming laptops has maximum 4 hrs battery backup ..But hp victus can easily run for 5-6 hrs. -It has fast charging support so it get charged quikly . CONS - Build quality is is little poor, it's screen wobbles a bit but don't worry it would not irratate u. Don't consider it's wobble issue for not buying this laptop.i was also confused regarding it's wobble issue but trust me it's not that much . -i feel it's brightness and sound is little low but it is managable. -I wish there could be a HP logo also on laptop but nowhere it is mentioned, only victus branding is provided -Victus logo can get scratches , protect that using laminate or take care of that  Overall it is a very good deal under 75 k."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,The delivery was spot on as promised. Packaging and delivery no issues. To get it started was a breeze. No need for any external paid assistance. The only major issue that is noticed is the screen shaking a bit when opened and needs extra care if handling. Overall I recommend this one.
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,Been using it for a couple of hours tested couple of games like rise of the tomb raider on high settings TBH i am quite satisfied with the performance will let you guys update soon the build quality is not bad don't be scared. And there is a slight wobble when air hits the chassis from the back but it's quite bearable just go for it ..
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,The wobbling of screen is very high and can damage the screen. How is this possible that the technical team did not notice this. Apart from that Screen is just 60hz so there is no point of giving 3050 RTX when you can't play games above 60fps because of monitor. The sound and camera is pathetic. Processing speed and graphics in gameplay is excellent but cannot play above 60fps. The monitor is 1080p and is not that great. It has plastic decent build and looks a bit fragile. I request hp to send technician to fix the wobbling issue in the laptop.
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Look is premium, Body is sturdy, hard plastic, display is good. Battery life is good, using since last 3.5 hr and still 55% battery remaining. lightning fast speed, keyboard is good. No fan noise on normal day to day work but if you want to play games small fan noise is there. overall value for money."
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,Looks: Awesome Build Quality: Not Best But Above Average Display: Awesome Performance: Awesome Battery : Impressive  Go for It 👍🏻
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,Overall you have everything in this laptop.  There’s no heating issues Large Amount of battery Great bright display Great specs Sexy keyboard And lots more....  The only drawback I felt is the screen just wobbles a little under a fan . But it could be fixed once you give a support of a book or something behind the display(remember while doing so don’t cover the air removing area)
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Booking.com, express vpn , Dropbox, Macafee was pre-installed and unable to uninstall express vpn."

HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,The only issue is disply wobble and colour accuracy apart from these this is the best laptop in this price range
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Keyboard is very tactile, touchpad is huge like MacBook's and XPS's build quality feels solid in my hand compared to my old Dell Inspiron 3567 speakers are loud enough loud enough for watching YouTube and Netflix and prime. Overall I'm really happy with my purchase 10/10"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,I don't like the screen wobble in this laptop and the screen is dim .these are the defects and afterall the laptop is perfect
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,HP Victus is built awesomely. Except being on wrong side for weight there is nothing else you will hardly won't like about this laptop. If you are looking for a personal all rounder go for it.
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"The laptop performance is great and smooth. Main draw backs are just 60hz refresh rate and bending of screen Battery lasts 5 hrs on normal use RTX 3050 is just awesome 💥💥 Great gaming and video editing experience... I bought at 71900.It was a killer deal,With RTX 3050 and Ryzen 5600h at around 72k"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Battery life awesome, and temps are also fine , but there is no battery charge limit option, which is kinda concerned while playing gaming when plugged in, it will decreases the battery life span, Please add that option in future updates"
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"This is a decent looking laptop with high performance, GTA V runs so smooth on RTX 3050. Close your eyes and buy this."

HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Just spent a day with Victus. The wobble is surprisingly less and the build feels quite good. Will test a few days for thermals and battery life. For now, this looks like an amazing deal!"

HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,Dislike
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,I don't liked the buils quality it's looking cheap.  Other better options are available on Amazon it self with leading gaming brand.  Not recommended at all..
HP-16-1-inch-Graphics-Flicker-16-e0076AX,laptop,"Don't know my piece is faulty or not but I updated windows and bios, nvidia drivers, amd drivers. Then tested cenebench 23, video rendering, played games, each time temperature is reaching 100°c + I lifted laptop from bottom for good air circulation and room temperature was 24°c raining outside."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"MacBook Pro is not repairable. This is especially true for MacBook Pro 2018 and later. Any small problem will cost you more than 1 lac  What if SSD fails? RAM fails? WiFi/Bluetooth not working? MacBook not charging? MacBook not turning on? You will be trapped in Apple's ploy. All these components are soldered into the logic board. They are inseparable. For all these problem Apple will ask you to replace your entire logic board. It will cost you more than 1 lac.  Third party repair is not an option for MacBook Pro 2018 and later. Apple is now very strict with its supply chain. Apple have made contracts with the OEMs that they cannot sell any chip (Such as the ISL9239, ISL9240, CD3215 and CD3217) outside Apple. This was not the case in prior generations. All this is done so that you cannot repair your new MacBook outside Apple."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"My MacBook Pro suddenly stopped working after 3 weeks of purchasing it. Took it to Apple service center and they gave a report saying that the hardware is faulty. As we crossed the return period of 1 week, Amazon is not returning or replacing the product. The only option left is to give it for repair and my brand new laptop needs to be opened and repaired by the service center. This is absurd and Amazon customer service has only one response that is to get it repaired."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,M1 goodness is here! Very powerful with pretty amazing battery life. A no brainer for any photographer or cinematographer to add it in there kit! Others are better off with the latest MacBook Air M1! It’s so much for so less! Thickness - 4.9 Value for money - 4.8 Sheerness - 4.9
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Cons COST IS TOO HIGH Cost Is High As per $ Price and No Variation available You still only get Thunderbolt 3 ports No support for Wi-Fi 6  Pros 3733Mhz 16GB LPDDR4X RAM. Latest 10th Generation Intel ""Ice Lake"" Core i5 processor :coding , photo and video editing feels smoother. Graphics : Iris Plus integrated graphics which Apple claims is up to 80 per cent faster than the previous generation MacBook Pro. Excellent Retina display. 61W USB-C adaptor . Awesome new Magic Keyboard. Thin touch-enabled mini-screen forward of the keyboard called the Touch Bar."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am IT professional so I am giving the feedback accordingly. Mostly working in DevOps tools.  If you try to install github cli , you may face challenges. Clipgrab doesn’t work to download youtube videos but YouTube-dl command line works. Some softwares you need to run Xcode —install again. If you install it once but next time you are going to install another software , you may need to run the xcode command.  1. Happy to purchase the product. 2. Amazon deliver the product on time. 3. Battery life far better as they mentioned 4. Power and speed I would not comment because I am not playing any games but boot up and shutdown is extremely fast 5. Sound is better then previous Mac. 6. Touch pad/bar is extremely cool, slight touch works but rarely require to use it , it’s just few days attractions. 7. Bluetooth and Wifi connectivity is better."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Love love ❤️ love ❤️ I used to use MacBook Air 2017 before this. Fcpx render which used to take 3-4hrs for 1.5gb file, this one takes only 4-5 min max.  And above all the design, built quality is as usual comes beyond expectations when product is made by apple."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Likes: It is really looking good and super fast.it is made with metal.. feels so strong and thin.. Delivery is so quick.. in one day I received.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Upgraded to this machine from macbook pro mid 2012 although it was still nice and working but this one is super fast in terms of performance and super quite on mid2012 a slight noise of hard disk was always audible but ssd is a thing for this decade.!  Switching from 500gb HDD on older mac to 256 gb ssd. A but compromise on storage but who cares those extra space we dont need much space for keeping movies now and 256 is manageable.  I do like the new keyboard.. everyone keep saying that butterfly keyboard was a hell for macs before 2020 but i did not got the lucky chance to type on a butterfly. People are also saying that this is most advance and improved keyboard on mac well it might be but i liked the old style chiclet keyboard much better than any other modern mac keyboard. It was classy although i will get used to it and forget about the experience of old chiclet  Also i got rid of my last device that can run compact disks sooner or later this was going to happen but i feel sorry for those disc that are still lying in my cupboard At last this device is a great thing to have in 2021 and beyond if you are a mac os lover and want a product to be with you for atleast 5 years. M1 is a new era and its time to bid adeu to intel P.S it was nice to have you with us till now but its time to get rid of you no more intel inside Overall for more better review there are videos on internet. I am just sharing my experiences of new macbook pro M1 as compared to my old mac
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I upgraded from a Macbook Pro 2018 Touchbar model. My reason was simple. Big Sur was lasting me barely 4 hours and my keyboard was giving me trouble. I still havent managed to sell that model but I'm sure I will soon. Anyway, I have used this long enough to know what I like about this and what i dont like. I think most things will be fairly obvious and my review is one that is ideal for someone who is well versed with the Macbook Universe. This is my 5th Macbook and the first new one I have purchased since the 2015 model. Usually I buy used models and they seem to run fine. But this time the price and the value proposition and the fact that there was very little difference between the used and new price made me buy this on a 3 month emi.  Pros of m1 macbook pro - a) BATTERY A+ I love not having to charge this macbook. If I charge it to 100% on a Friday Evening and use it at night for 2-3 horus, use it on all of Saturday for 3-4 hours and use it for 2 hours on Sunday, I will probably be left with about 30% battery. That is a big deal. But Apple is not without blame as they keep giving less battery with newer Mac OS. I will talk of that later. Of course if you have brightness on full blast and are doing video converting the battery life may just be 8 hours but I can guarantee at least 10 hours screen on time doing whatever you want. I charge my Macbook once it reaches low levels. So far I have used 18 cycles and the battery is still at original 100% capacity. I expect it deteroirate to 90% in one year and maybe down to 81% after 24 months. I will update you i promise.  b) Display - The display has improved from 2018 model. It is brighter, sharper, youtube videos and MacOS looks almost perfect on this display. Since there is a lockdown I havent taken it out much but it definitely lesser reflective than the 2018 version so that is a good job.  c) Keyboard - I liked the 2018 keyboard but after 45 days of using it when I use the other keyboard, I feel that this is so much more enabling. The keystrokes are good. It took me 7 days to get used to this keyboard but now I am happy they made this transition. All keys are working very well.  d) Power - When I use this to convert a video file, it usually gets done in about 240 seconds. The max time it ever takes on FCP is like ten minutes. It is obviously faster on opening tabs and the basic but yes the power is good.  e) No Heat - My 2018 used to get very hot but the M1 Macbook Pro is always cool. I keep this on my stomach when I am lying down and it never warms up. I have heard the fans operate just 1-2 times in 45 days of owning this. So thats a major plus and something you should not take for granted. Heat is the biggest enemy of battery life.  f) Improved HD camera - its gone from a 4/10 to a 6.5/10 and apple still needs to improve.  g) At Rs 1,17,000 i think this is worth the price. You can keep this computer for at least 3 years and sell it for about 50% of the price which is acceptable to me at least.  h) The touchbar surface is a little more raised and not flush like the 2018 model. This makes for better use. Also the touch id button is better to the touch. This is a good imrpovement.  i) The trackpad remains best in class. Fun to use.  CONS  a) SCREEN gets dirty, smudged up after use. This is really sad. I bought some equipment from amazon to wipe screen but they are not helping. No matter what you do - the screen will get ugly and have marks over time. b) 2 usb c ports are not good enough as when placed next to one another they are often difficult to use. Also now I can;'t always use my charger as its easy to reach only on right hand side but not the left hand side. So like now when I am typing, the macbook is on battery. These guys should give one usb c port each side. c) The sound is about 80% as loud as the 2018 Macbook Pro. They have made it a little quieter. This is not acceptable apple. d) MacOS next generation will again kill its battery performance. I can't believe Apple made me upgrade to a new computer by slowing down the older Macbook. This is bad business. e) Mail app has become poor and also I am noticing the Macbook is never indexed properly. So for example, Mail will take a lot of processing power but not give results. I have just 4 accounts linked and think this is not acceptable. Gmail website performs way better than apple inbuilt email. f) Apple ends up taking gb of data in cache and 70% users dont know how you have to get rid of it. Every apple user has to buy clean my mac. why can't apple itself become better on this front? g) I need a camera as good as my iphone and this is nowhere near.  CONCLUSION - This machine is worth the asking price. I am leaving 4 stars for now and will update in six months time.  If this is your first macbook, you will fall in love with Apple again. If you are upgrading from a recent macbook, you need to read this review again. If you are stuck on a 2015 or older machine, just buy this."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Apple really went all out with this M1 Macbook Pro.  Its way more powerful than i5 for sure. Go for it and those worried about 8GB Ram. I have been using it for a week for Mobile App development and it runs very smoothly even with simulators and XCode. No issues at all.  The only issue I can think of is that Apple didn't provide a chip with more Graphic power compared to the Macbook Air. Not that the GPU is bad by itself but very few people would really need this Pro model over the Air. It does have the touch bar and much better Sound and a fan for prolonged heavy usage. Also the apps are ready for M1 so don't worry about incompatibility either. Most apps work Native or some unupdated ones with Rosetta 2.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am a hard-core developer. Daily I used this system for around 8 hours, with these things open. 1. Node server 2. Mongo Server 3. Android studio 4. VS code with 3 Project open 5. XCode 6. Chrome with min 8 tabs always.  In this much open in my ubuntu with 16GB RAM & I5 not working properly. faced crashed very several times. This is a beast. You are never going to regrate on this for sure. Good Battery, Best performance."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,MacBook was faulty and was not able to connect with any iPhone. May be the used product hence returned and got refund
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It is a mistake buying from Amazon, this laptop is generally good, but don't buy it from Amazon, these sellers will send you defective, faulty piece. It have so much problem and hangs so much, Jitters so much. I REGRET EVERY F'IN DAY AGTER BUYING THIS FROM AMAZON. buy from anywhere Dont buy from here Wish I could give 0 stars"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Best performance with sturdy body. Less heating than expected from high graphics softwares
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The device is functioning well and delivery was excellent.  However, the initialisation was a little cumbersome. The invoice sent doesn't carry the Serial Number of the MacBook. It is yet to be registered on my name.  I will soon buy from the store Apple Maintenance Plan when I will be able to register the MacBook!  Would you let me know a way to have the invoice with the Serial Number of the MacBook?"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Pros: No heat, long battery, smooth performance, nice build quality. I use it for coding and learning. I use it run Eclipse IDE and VSCode editor and use Chrome exhaustively, but it just works superbly. Boot time is negligible and wake from sleep is flawless. It is easy to carry. Cons: metallic build leaves mark on lap after prolonged usage. It is not as loud as 16 inch version. Though 16 inch version with Intel inside produces a lot of heat. The compactness causes it to feel heavy and you need to be careful while lifting and shifting."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Amazing
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"As an avid Apple fan, I was really excited to get this M1 MacBook Pro as my first ever Mac. And going a few weeks using it, it definitely lives up to its reputation! I have the 512gb SSD 8gb RAM configuration. Battery: It sips battery life and I can easily last a day of extensive graphic designing and editing and a few hours worth of calls and still have a little below 50% left! Ecosystem: I already had an iPhone and an iPad and getting another Apple device just adds into the ecosystem. I can receive calls, transfer documents and carry over my work from one device to another! Performance: This MBP boasts power. Most apps open instantly from Chrome to Adobe Premiere Pro and it handles tasks like a beast! It has a gorgeous display perfect for color accurate work and has loud, extremely good speakers. Attending calls and multitasking is super intuitive and with macOS Big Sur the whole system is snappy. It’s so good, that I almost never shut it down, it instantly wakes up from sleep and I’m ready to get going! Really there are only some minor inconveniences here: There are only two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. That is a limitation at times. It’s a bit heavy at 1.4kg but if most of your work is mostly desk orientated, then it shouldn’t be a problem. Another “issue” is the app compatibility thing with M1. Since these Macs are now ARM based and not x64 like their Intel counterparts, you may run into some silly stuff occasionally. But that’s part of the process. I’d suggest you check in advance if your favorite and essential apps are working with these Silicon macs. Overall, anyone looking to upgrade their experience to a whole new level, look no further! I have been loving this machine so much that I doubt that I’m ever returning back to Windows!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,My old 2016 12 inch MacBook was struggling to load multiple charts so I needed a new laptop. The m1 was blazing fast in loading them and scrolling through them was super smooth. I can finally say that apple did a good job on the GPU side too. The battery life is decent . Apple also got back the old scissor keyboard on the M1 which was something I really missed on my old mac with the butterfly keyboard which had no feedback at all.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It's a good macbook. I expected the new M1 chip to be something unique, but it's nice. It's been a month since I bought and there have been issues like black screen, printer setup issues, machine getting slightly warmer (claim is excellent cooling but it sometimes doesn't work well), screen tends to attract lot of dust. All in all, it's a good buy but what one expects from Apple is way more :-)"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Absolute masterpiece! Battery - 10/10 Screen - 8.5/10 Speakers - 9/10 Performance- 10/10  The most amazing thing about the M1 Macbook Pro is the Battery. Charge it once and forget about recharge for next 5-6 days.  I have not restarted the device for 2-3 months now, because it doesn’t need that. Everything is so instant.  You can only know when you use it."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I have been a Mac user for last 10 years. I just upgraded myself with this MacBook Pro 2020 2.0 Ghz quad core 10 th gen i5 1TB 16 GB ram from a MacBook Air. I love macOS user experience. And this piece machine is just awesome. I preferred this version over the base version for many reasons - 1. newer 10th gen core i5 processor with two cooling fans for much improved heat rejection, 2. four thunderbolt ports are really handy which gives you more flexibility and options, 3. 16Gb ram is for great performance and smooth multitusking, 4. speakers are better compared to base model, 5. I won't get outdated soon enough, at least for 5-6 yers I guess, 6. I preferred 1TB SSD for not getting out of space which was the case with MacBook Air I had and is a better option if money is not an issue, otherwise 512GB is also an option. So far I am happy the way the machine is performing and as I said I love the apple eco system. I would like to appreciate the hassle free delivery of amazon and also the seller Appario for the genuine piece and great packaging."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Being a dedicated Apple user since 2011, there really was no ""selling"" required for me to make this decision. My primary machine was a 3.5 year old Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 that server me well and through more than normal usage. It survived rigorous pic/video editing, live-streaming and other multimedia heavy activities but had gotten worn down. Simply because it was the best fit for those kinds of jobs. I've always wanted to switch to a Mac but was held back due to budget limits. This time I was in the market and the windows configuration that I was looking for was also in the 90-95 k range. So it really wasn't too much of a stretch to go for a Mac (Finally). Ok, enough of the back story and on to the review. The Mac is really an artist's tool. It is loaded with so many cool features (although it is also annoying that apple decides to remove some of the useful features on a whim - such as the MagSafe charger). I've used this for a month now and have been actively editing and posting content on my YouTube channel using the tools build in. Quite frankly its a breeze. One may not notice any huge difference when using email, browsing the net or working on office apps - to the extent of even thinking what's the big fuss all about? But the real power of the Mac shows when you're doing video renders of your edited content. That's where it really tells you that its money well spent. Oh, the battery life is just monstrous. I charge it only every other day. I don't need to connect a charger every day. That is something Ive never experienced on any windows machine. If you have the money, GO for it!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Its of very bad quality. Gives a blur vision to the display when looked closely and will get scratched even from wiping from fingers. Not at all worth. Just the fit is proper everything else is cheap quality not more than 150-200
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Bit Costly but heavy duty , Very good for high end programming. Very stable machine .. No lag . Touch Pad is magic pad .. it has many features but many don t know how to use . if one learns then handling the screens hop would be cake walk."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"There is always great hype about Apple products and most of the time they are true but not the same with apple laptop  If you talk about hardware build quality durability it's great  But but why Microsoft survive on this earth is apple poor software, it's just brand new laptop and I see face time crashing  Even when I was completing the step first it took a while to connect to wifi Then when on the way I need to setup Siri I was asked chose voice 1 , voice 2 I could not choice any , so skipped this setting like many other I chose too  Then installing eclipse software it was unsuccessful  Forget about their privacy selling point we know what pageasus spying software could do  Apple please work on your software also and make it bug free and user friendly else already people installing windows on MacBook"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"There's nothing to dislike about this laptop. The M1 chip is so fast and efficient that the Intel chips do not even come close. Battery on MacBook Pro M1 lasts much longer than any other laptop in this price range and even beyond. The True Tone display has a very amazing colour accuracy. The trackpad is huge with Force Touch and haptics, works flawlessly everytime. Only someone with absolutely no knowledge of using a Touchbar would say it isn't useful, well you can use it much like an Apple Watch on your keyboard. The Magic Keyboard gives you the best typing experience ever on a laptop. Speakers are loud with a fair amount of low end and wide stereo image. Overall a great laptop, if not best, for everyone. It handles everything you throw at it. I would highly recommend this to everyone looking for a new laptop in this price range in 2021."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This my first macbook pro m1. Overall exprience is great. Happy with purchase. Very fast and run smoothly. Also the screen quality is also top class and sound is crystal clear.the trackpad is also very impressive not like windows laptop tracpad. finger print scanner is also very fast. Also the sound recognisation is very impressive siri is very quickly response. I used another windows gaming pc with 16 gb ddr4 ram and intel ssd but on windows its still sometimes lags. But in macos all is run smoothly.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Magnificent, but had to return. M1 is a game-changer. I ran 4 4K videos from youtube ( connected external display) In parallel, a teams meeting call, and a fully loaded python IDe(spyder from anaconda). Did above for 30 mins. It managed it with 6GB RAM and 1GB swap. Didn't hear up, didn't hear the fans either. No lags anywhere. Problem: though it claims 720p which is standard across most laptops, the video quality was sub par, and very grainy. Amazon helped replace this but the replacement was none better. Hence returned. I didn't try FaceTime or any other app, if Video was not clear on teams call, it is blocker for me. Other than this, I strongly vouch for this. Since it didn't get heated up on my stress test(even my dell - i7 with 16gb, doesn't land smooth on the test) , I think even the cheaper Macbook Air M1 can be given a try. I bought macmini same specs from apple store itself, since I needed badly and they were delivering next day. Luckily it has ports to handle my spare peripherals . Macbook comes with only 2 thunderbolt ports , which includes charge port. You'd invariably need to invest in hubs/adaptors."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am relatively new to the apple Ecosystem. MacBook Pro was the final device that completed it. all these devices are so well integrated that sometimes I forget if its my iPad my phone or my MacBook. I am really enjoying it. TBH I am not a heavy user. I browse I study and do pretty basic stuff on it. its been a joyful experience, though. there is zero lag. my tactile senses are overwhelmed by the feel of the keyboard and the touchpad. THE BATTERY IS A BEAST!!!! I last charged it to a 100% on the 27th of June and used it for about 2 to 3 hours everyday. I am still sitting at 22%. and that will carry me easily to Monday. THE SPEAKERS ROAR!! mind you this is a laptop after all.  so for everyone out there who doesn't have a MacBook, wants a MacBook and can afford a MacBook.. please go for it. YES IT IS EXPENSIVE, no joke. and one can argue that there are comparable laptops out there but its an experience like none other I can tell you that."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I bought a 512 GB / 8 GB MAC model (Space Grey) Macbook Pro M1. Great product, faster than many MAC models. Front camera though looks blurry in medium/low light and that is a total disappointment when you are spending a huge amount on Apple devices. It is so blurry even your 2013 Mac model would look better in front of it. Battery life though is really good and Apple's tall claims of 20 hours of battery life are pretty much good. The only problem is they are using a simulator Rosetta for lot of applications which may or may not be simulating it perfectly. I haven't found a problem as of now but read a lot of reviews on YouTube. Not tested the gaming environment for now, so no comments on that. I would recommend to wait for some new MAC model with improvements to the M1 chip.  Also, I recently bought this and I'm pretty new to exploring the MAC environment myself, Amazon did put a price drop on this within a week and now they do not agree to match the price. Really sad when you buy products like these and the price drop and they are not ready to match it, instead they suggest to place another order and return the existing order which I think is downright insane.  Overall product is fine though, if not for Amazon sucky price match policy. Disappointed with Amazon though on this part."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Everything works smooth, you can download iphone/ipad apps too. Battery, display, charging and performance is excellent. Didn't played any game and I don't want to. I found only one issue that samsung ssd is not compatible with M1 chip so waiting for an software update. I use this laptop for casual use and this machine exceed my expectations. Professional users should be careful since many software are not compatible with M1 chip."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I received a faulty piece and after few hours of usage it started flickering and sometime black screen. There is issue in the keyboard as well.  I connected with an agent, they denied the replacement and asking to get the same repaired. I am really upset with this product . I have seen so many people complaining about it. Never buy anything from amazon"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I was looking to upgrade from my MBP 2015, But I had no reasons too. Apple was still using intel i5's, also I really did not like the keyboard made after 2015. IMHO, 2015 was the last great MacBook Apple made. But fast forward to 2020, Apple did it's magic, no more Intel's (RIP) no more butterfly keyboards. It was my time to officially retire my trusty workhorse. I was waiting for M1X, M2 but since it did not happen, I went with M1. What should I say? Reviews are real this is the future of chips. It's redundant, but when Apple decides to do something, they do it right and this what this beast is. Everything is top notch, the keyboard, microphone, webcam, software compatibility. This machine checks every single checkmark. If you are into creative work/developer get this machine, you will thank yourself. I did not go with Air since, I'm developer and I work large projects which take sometime to compile. I did not want to take any risks so I went with MacBook with a fan. Once you go Mac, you'll never go back."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"As expected from Macbook Pro M1, excellent having in possession both iMac 2021 and Macbook Air 2017. Battery life is exceptional. Speaker sound is clear but not very loud. Display being 2K is pleasure to look at. I find touchbar useful in certain context. Everything else is great. More and more apps are getting native M1 support and this trend will continue."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"My MacBook and it’s launch pad randomly freezes .Even the apps , force quitting options don’t work it too . I have to forcefully shut it down . Before it shuts down it gives a solid color and then shuts down"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Battery life : not able to kill it in a day even after intensive work ( including editing in final cut pro )  Thickness: weight management is perfect, not at all bulky. Its a very powerful and light machine  Ram management: Just perfect. 8gb is sufficient. I am able to open around 60 to 90 tabs in safari plus final cut pro plus Microsoft word, excel and using side car with ipad all at once and not even a single lag or drop its butter smooth.  Performance in editing: Editing 8k videos HDR content in final cut pro. Butter smooth editing experience even in best quality mode. Only render time suffers during exporting HDR 4k video file. If you are exporting no HDR file then rendering and exporting is hyper fast. So M1 chip is really making everything seems so fluid and fast.  Comparison with other laptops:  This laptop has spoiled me. I tried to go back to windows for a work but made me realise as if i am using some old machine from past. ( windows laptop that i was using was also launched this year with latest specifications)  Final conclusion:  If you do lots of editing Go for Pro model if your budget allows  Dont stretch your budget if you can afford macbook air M1  Only if you need consistent high performance for prolonged period then buy this pro model else go with macbook air model Both are equally powerful.  Cons:  Less ports Thats it."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Vibrates on charging..leakage of current .looses bluetooth connectivity ...Bad experience
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It is a great computer (M1 MacBook Pro 512GB SSD), although I personally the speakers though are far better on the intel MacBook Pro. The M1 mac is comparitively faster and battery backup is much better than the intel MacBook Pro. There are some compatibility issues, due to it being a Apple Silicon chip, not all apps are supported, for which you would require to download Rosetta. I was hesitant on buying such a costly computer from Amazon, seeing some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised, Amazon did a great job in delivering the package on time, even in this pandemic, the package was in perfect order. Great job Amazon 👍"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I own MSI GE 63 Raider 8SF. The purpose of purchasing a Macbook Pro i5 10th Gen with 16 GB RAM 512 GB SSD was to maintain a separate development environment and portability. Though I am having the heavily configured MSI which never failed me with respect to gaming, development and performance it was always very hard to move with the laptop. It gave very less battery backup (1hour) so you always need to carry this laptop with a charger. But now as Macbook is there, it is very easy to carry it, which never fails you performance wise as the RAM of 16 GB is more than enough for developing any application in java, it also has a great emulator support for android and iOS development with no compatibility issues which were found in the latest M1 Macbook pros. For a person who wants to purchase this laptop for development and graphic designing type of professional work, this machine is a big thumbs up for you. So far the Macbook pro i5 10th Gen is giving me 10-11 hours of battery life, that means in the morning if you charge the laptop it will not die until you go and have your evening snack. Keyboard experience is also amazing and some times it is fun to use the touch bar, unless most people don't like it, I personally found it stylish, premium and useful. The bigger track pad and centre positioning of the track pad feels very helpful."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I am reviewing after 2 month use -Its value of money 💸. Its better for machine learning. Battery backup is also very good more than 20hrs .
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Product is undoubtedly good. But if you are a developer and you run apps like android studio and Xcode then consider 16gb ram. 8 gb ram is sometimes not sufficient and it is not upgradable. Also with new os updates apple products seem to become slower so more ram will be helpful to maintain speed in future.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Everything is gud but it’s just been 1 month and I wish I could return. Donor buy from Amazon as it has refurbished ones At times my Mac has hissing abrupt noise at few times It’s just 1 month and Amazon product has started it’s issue When u pay so much but quality is the point
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"As promised, Apple really outperformed by using silicons.  - I use Macbook for 8-10 hrs daily and it mostly requires 1 time full charge each day. As I am using heavy softwares like XCode Simulators, Android Studio, etc.  If use case is normal like surfing internet, watching movies, documents editing, etc then it runs even longer ~12-14hrs in single full charge  - No fan noise at all!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"i have bought it a month ago , in start everything was good but now battery is draining in 1-2 hours"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I was thinking of iMac as mainly i will be using it for Photo editing. But then, got very sweet deal on this with exchange of my old Mac Air and HDFC Card. So, went with it. So far, loving it. Beautiful display, amazing battery life, fast and always cool - what else you need on a normal laptop with bit of editing work."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I've used this laptop for the past 10 months. I'm happy with everything other than the fact that these Intel Macs are getting pretty hot when you really work them. So you've gotta ensure you keep them on a flat surface or invest in a laptop stand.  Other than that, everything else is top class. If you want the familiarity of the x86 architecture and have to run certain applications natively or use Windows occasionally buy this or a 16 inch. (something to ponder) - the 13 Inch Ram - 3733 Mhz DDR4x vs the 16 inch Ram - 2666 Mhz DDR4..  Consider looking at M1 Macs as Apple is phasing out Intel soon(2022). Most MacOS features will soon be only available on M1 and not on Intel and you most likely won't receive updates in the next 4-5 years. Longevity points go to M1! Buy this machine if you want to run x86 applications natively. Note: Rosetta 2 is a very good translator but not the same as native 'right now' no matter what anyone tells you. A Laptop needs to help you get the job done. This MacBook does the job, with stellar build quality. I love the laptop."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,The laptop is very cool and working nice. The charger wire was very cheap and you could see the white colour dust on my hand. It will not long last. Also the laptop cutting edge is too sharp. I am getting mark on my hand while using. It may harm when you forcefully or accedentally falling on it. Cost is also slightly high for this china assembled product. I think the repairing cost is also high.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"If you've been using an Intel chip-based MacBook for now then I highly recommend you switch to Apple Silicon because these are faster. There is a short-term problem which is the compatibility of certain software but it should not be a reason for not buying an M1 chip-based MacBook. If there is only one software or a few software that your work on and they are yet not fully compatible on M1 then only I will recommend waiting. These machines are quieter, faster, powerful but lack support on some common software. But that is not a problem because constant work is happening on all these software to make it compatible with the M1 and M2 chips (to be announced later this year)."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Liked the performance of the Pro its secure inbuilt functionalities , the Touch Bar comes in handy and is a good addition that imparts a net gen ease of functionality and style to the laptop I disliked the 720 p camera as it should be upgraded too as it does not gel well with the quality of Apple MacBook's hardware and display . the camera should be upgraded to 1080 P at least"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The M1 MacBook Pro is a different beast altogether. Superior performance in terms of Graphics rendering, app opening and system turn on and most importantly Out of the world battery life. The thermal performance is way better than the intel chips based MacBook pros , despite playing Graphics intensive games (Asphalt 9) while copying files from an external hard drive , still didn’t trigger the fans to go high speed … so far a great experience. Only wish it came in 16"" screen size"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Using this since last month. The machine is good and the speed is far better than the previous apples. Adobe and other heavy softwares opens within 3 seconds. It’s awesome. Only thing I should have purchased 16 inches screen however this works fine.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I’m impressed with the speed of delivery. Received it in less than a day. The battery capacity is way better than windows laptops as applications in Mac OS as far more energy efficient. Needless to say, you can get more done If you have an apple ecosystem."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Gets turned off when I play any music, problem using internal speakers, and now it gets switched on automatically when I fold and pack the laptop in bag. Sometimes it gets switched off if I play songs without connecting earphones... It is very bad product I must say, not worth value for money as well. Heating problem when connected to charger. Charger heating problem as well... Heating problem is when I use OBS for streaming...!!!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"For my needs, it's doing a fabulous job. If you are planning to buy, just check reviews on how this mac with new processor is performing with the softwares you want to use."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I have been using Apple products since a decade now and have never faced any issues with them. Of course it’s a value for money product which go on forever. They have also improved a lot of the quality and finish of the product.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Perfect laptop for developers. I'm upgrading from MacBook Air 2015 and this machine is 5 times faster! My webpack build used to take 200 seconds and this takes less than 40 seconds! Extremely powerful and efficient for my work.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Performance and battery life is on par. The only thing I didn't like as of now not many apps or softwares are optimised for M1 and there are only two USB c ports that too one side.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The laptop is light and sleek, but after just couple of months usage, the laptop satrted giving mild shock when connected to charger.  When contacted the server center, was rudely informed that it is a exected behaviour and it's okay.  After buying a premium laptop from Apple, I certainly didn't expect to have this experience from Apple."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Very good product, battery life more than expected, boots in no time, ease of operation. Webcam picture quality disappointing."

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"This happens quite randomly and I couldn't take a photo as it just flicker and restarts. After restart there is option to report issue which I did but nothing changed. Also the laptop gets heated alot when used for prolonged hours and I sometimes need to restart it manually to improve performace. Really disappointed after spending so much money for this product. I am not able to get any support, please help."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Great performance, battery life and speed"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Amazing, received the product within a day. Well packaged and delivered. Have always trusted Appario Retail. This machine is a monster. I swear by Apple, this is my 4th Apple laptop. Purchased this and the Apple air M1 together, just perfect 👌🏻"

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Excellent screen quality, Better battery life. Lags when you are copying data to a external Hard disk and also when you are importing photos from your iphone. For the rest, be assured, apple will not let u down. Apple has made this machine to give you different experience than other laptops. RAM could have been more, lagging is the result of that much short memory."

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I have never purchase such a costly stuff from Amazon but overall happy with the product and the price I have got it. Super laptop, brilliant experience..!!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The camera and touch tab stopped working within 4 months of purchasing the machine. No support or replacement available. Certainly not worth to invest in this machine just for the performance, better machines are available in the market at much cheaper rates. Wait for the more evolved models."

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,good
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Terrible product. Heating and poor thermal is a major issue. I purchased my MacBook from local authorised reseller Imagine. They have poor aftersale service unlike Amazon with no return policy. The laptop became a dead brick within 2 weeks of purchasing it and neither Apple or Imagine will replace it and can’t repair it also because as a result of the lock down they don’t have the necessary spare parts. As a result I am stuck with 1.5lac worth new MacBook which is dead. Might as well got a HP or Dell for half the cost. I would have spent less and had a functional laptop. Pathetic aftersale service from Apple.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I bought it from US. Product is good and base model is value for money but has 8th gen processor .That wasn't expected from Apple. Just 1 fan in base model slower DDR3 ram
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I'm not an Apple/SteveJobs fan but had been using a couple of their main products purely for their worthiness.  Short summary of M1 MacBook pro: Certainly as many pro reviews will tell you M1 is blowing away intel processors and the machine runs cool all the time even with ~20 safari windows open along with MS XL, word, ppt and a bunch of other wares running. Battery does last 15+ hours on normal usage like above (although I didn't test it to full extent). App launches are NOT as fast as I had expected -my 2012 MacBook pro with Samsung SSD launches apps considerably faster. Big Sur OS isn't fully baked yet, there are issues. Safari occasionally goes unstable. Touch Bar is the biggest disappointment. I'm kicking myself over my decision to buy pro machine rather than Air which has F keys instead of this stupid bar. Its functionality and thought is poor -while typing fast my fingers just slightly touch a key on touchbar and it ends up in an unwanted action like sleep. Trackpad is unnecessarily larger than it has to be. Many times while typing I realise that my words have gone in another paragraph or another file as macOS cannot distinguish my palm from fingers. No matter how much I played with the settings it keeps behaving in the same annoying manner -this is just another reason to prefer Air over Pro as Air has smaller trackpad. But Macbook's trackpad traditionally has been one of the most reliable and to-die-for things. I never ever had the issue with palm detection on either of my earlier MacBooks. As far as I was concerned this was a behaviour of HP, DELL and similar PCs. It's extremely disappointing that a good thing turned bad (Just now as I typed the last word ""bad"", volume got muted --god knows how, my fingers were way too far away from Touch Bar.) Trackpad cannot be used in touchscreen mode (for scribbling in meetings) without additional software, can't explain the wisdom behind its size. I have also noticed that a few times that a software launches itself -as if the mac has a mind of its own.  My daily Time Machine backups to a local NAS (by QNAP) have been going on pretty reliably over last 7years. Now that's broken with BigSur. Each incremental backup takes a few hours even though the quantum of backup is only a few hundred MB. Even 68MB backup takes 2hours. Raised a ticket with ""Genius"" service, no solution in sight yet.  If someone wants to buy Mac I strongly advise to prefer higher end Air until Apple retires Touch Bar -one saves INR 20,000 with Air over Pro and gets almost the same CPU/GPU performance with 2 less kinks. For someone who want to migrate from PC to mac I advise one not to jump in without knowing it inside out. Macs are no longer much ahead of competition in terms of design. More on this in later part.  Background and My Perspective: I switched to mac in 2006 having been a Win-PC user for 8years before that. While the transition had initial hiccups I learnt to appreciate the reliability of the machines and the software powering them. Apple ad from the mid 2000s era ""it just works"" was really true. The extra money I invested in mac was totally worth it considering I never had to spend time troubleshooting software/hardware. I used my first mac (core 2 duo) for 6 years and bought another in 2012. 2006 MacBook rarely had a problem in the time it served. My shiny silver unibody MacBook pro has been very good and I still use it as a contingent machine. It was the last mac from Apple with good repairability index and over last 8 years I was able to upgrade memory and disk, replace trackpad, ssd cable, battery, and MagSafe power port. I'm sure I'll miss repairability on my new mac. Any problem would most likely mean I'll have to trash the machine.  Over the years, perhaps since the time SteveJobs died, I have seen a remarkable slide in quality of Apple's hardware, software and customer service. ""It just works"" claim no longer holds true and over the years the behaviour of the system has grown closer to 2000s Windows. I have also seen many issues that resolve by a reboot -this was one of the Apple's jokes on PC but now I'm rebooting M1 MacBook occasionally to see if a problem vanishes and shockingly it does on many occasions. 10 years ago I was brazenly unconcerned about malware on my mac but I'm concerned now. Their claims of macs being unhackable have fallen flat (This used to be one of the ads in Apple's make-fun-of-pc campaign).  In 2008 my first MacBook pro was replaced owing to a hardware problem and barring one incident during a botched up warranty repair (partly my mistake) I had a good experience with apple service. It seemed they really knew troubleshooting and weren't sheep-minded flowchart followers. But I cannot say that now. Today, every question whether for mac or iPhone is first met with a counter question ""is your software upto date"" and if it isn't they refuse to look into the issue no matter how irrelevant the update might be. I just stopped calling them.  In 2006 when I switched, MacBook was way ahead of competition and the price premium was well justified. The gap has narrowed down over the decade and Macs are still arguable an inch ahead but they no longer enjoyed the same advantage from 2015-2020. Apple silicon might be changing that in favour of macs with intel still struggling. Before M1, I strongly contemplated moving back to WinPC but performance reviews of M1 changed my decision."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Dont waste your time seeing the reviews in youtube, just have it! You will never ever turn back to Windows. (Was a lifetime windows user)"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,The M1 Chip is Heart of this product. The performance is so improved and flawless. The display is so good. The battery is also improved.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I will not post in details about overall MacBook pro but will only focus on improvement as compared to intel MacBook Pro version. Overall performance has definitely improved, it is faster & just like iPhone or iPad it wake up in a second. Keyboard feels much better (I had MacBook Pro 2017 version with butterfly keyboard). Giving 4 stars as many application crashed or stop responding -I am guessing its because of M1 compatibility.  For a performance - I was able to export 300 RAW images in Lightroom in under 15 minutes- which generally use to take 40-45 minutes on my MacBook Pro 2017 version or 35 min on my Lenovo Yoga series i7 laptop.  Battery - as of writing this review, it has been 36 hours since I got this laptop. After charing it for 100 % it gave me 5-6 hours of usage (Youtube, Lightroom, Web browsing, Citrix for work with dual monitor & wireless headset) and close to 8 hours of sleep mode before battery went to 10% which is more than double of what I use to get with my 2017 MacBook."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,For the Indian pricing it's a NO GO! Just spend 20k more and get the 16 inch. Since it also has dedicated graphics.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"To be honest, It lags too much even in comparison to Macbook Air 2017 model.  I'm really unhappy with my big investment in this Pro M1.  Thumbs down"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The machine on waking from sleep does not respond. That is the trackpad and keyboard do not work for about 30 seconds. This is so annoying ! On contacting apple care through online chat, they told me to perform updates and resets. Even after doing so, the laptop still hangs. I am using the latest Mac OS 10.15.6 in my laptop. Now i have to give my 2 week old laptop for repair. A laptop in which u spend more than 1.5 lacs, this is what you would get. A laptop that keeps hanging."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Got my latest Macbook pro M1. Definitely speed is something which was beyond my expectations its performance is damn good apple products is also being awesome in terms of performance as well as it's ecosystem. If you are looking for macbook then go with pro because macbook air can't give you sustainable performance while paying few extra buck pro is worth single penny.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I got the package delivered today. It is ""New Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 2.0GHz Quad-core 10th-Generation). Checked in Apple support site with the Serial Number. Got it registered there. But when i checked the AppleCare Support, I get the following information : It looks like your device isn’t eligible for an AppleCare agreement.  Can anyone help me with this?"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am using macbook pro for over 2 years now, and here is my suggestion to anyone who is considering to buy one. Go for a macbook only if you have deep pockets because even a small repair will cost you big amount of money. My macbook's battery now needs a replacement after 2 years of usage and the charge cycle has just reached 129 out of 1000, and they service center guys says it will cost me Rs 40,000 to get the battery replaced because its attached to the top cover of my laptop which will also be replaced.  So unless you are willing to spend thousands of rupees for your laptop maintenance, you should consider a non-apple laptop."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Hi All, I purchase MBP in beginning of August 2021 after single day I realised that lower panel of laptop cabinet is not capable to hold the weight of this machine. When I tried to pick it the lower panel (where the rubber are hinged) pressing in and touches the internal hardware. I have experienced that the body is pressing inside approx 1 or 2mm like a this Tin box. After that I went to local Apple Store and check the same machine but didn't experience anything like that. Second thing Apple Macs should be open by only single hand but day by day it is very difficult to open the led by even both hands. I can expect if little more time goes I might not open the LED of this machine, if I give more force than LED may break down. I can't expect this thing from Apple Macs.  Thanks"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"My daughter absolutely loves it. But unfortunately within 2 months it conked off and won’t reboot. First time ever faced such issue with an Apple product. Have submitted to an Apple service centre and it’s been one week already, yet no fix. They are saying mother board and other parts may need to be changed. Hopefully, they may be able to fix. But it’s a shocker."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,This is an amazing product and amazon is also giving an amazing disscount on it. the actual price on apple's site is nearly 1 lakh 22 thousand but here you are getting it for 1 lakh 7 thousand! 15 thousand rupees disscount! Plus you also get the exchange offer! I haven't bought this macbook but I will surely buy it for my coding and 3D sclulpting work.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"In terms of performance, battery life, and usability, nothing can even come close to this machine. The thermals are so well built on this M1, I purchased it around 40 days back and have been using it for AutoCad and designing, and even while running the heavy stuff, the fans didn't even kick in once. If we talk about battery life, it is just INSANE! If you are a light user, then just forget about charging it. You can run it for days and days. The performance is also very slick, app openings are just instant. The display is just stunning. Hats off APPLE for this beauty."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The fulcrum of entire Apple ecosystem. For people who want speed, power and finesse. Many many pros - for someone switching from a lifetime of Windows machines. Instant boot, insane battery life, end of task manager :)  I just find the control, option, command buttons a bit confusing. But that is just a small learning curve to get started.  So relived to finally get rid of my Xps!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Only the thing is we don't get extra ports also other windows laptops provide us a bagpack ! That's all the complaints I have.. Rest we mostly know this M1 is doing top notch.. I definitely recommend this pro 13 inch its lightweight , powerful, fast and obviously its not a gaming machine! For games you better buy Sony Ps4 or Ps5 those things are really awesome."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Why ""save 90"" when the maximum retail price is rs1,74900 then why is it rs174990???? Other than this I love the new MacBook Pro"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Amazing Product...Package was totally sealed and good too. Worth for the money😍 Battery life is awesome as I have been using it for hours but it lasts longer. Camera quality is also great!!!
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Nothing could be better!! far better than the old one,u can go for the air if you want somthing more light but it is a good buy overall 👌🏻👍🏻"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Nodoubt its good in term of every possible way but service after warranty ll make u cry thats for sure , macbook user since 2009 but now anyissue after warranty ll cost atleast 60 thousand ."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Performance of Apple M1 Mac Pro sets a benchmark, product quantity is good, battery life also increased with the new M1 chip."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Took this for screen quality and battery life , rated less for value for money since its pretty heavy on the pocket"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"A beast, a complete package for the ones who make music etc. An addictive device. I have been using this from the last year. Once you start using apple ecosystem there’s no going back . The only drawback i have found that it has only two type-c port."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,The product is nice but I would suggest to hold till it comes to your budget. This price in amazon falls like stock market. 20 days back I bought this at 1.2 lakh and bow it is 1.07 lakhs😡😡

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,It's value for money and way better than intel processor. It's battery life is just awesome. A better version of MacBooks
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,nice to buy but take 512gb only. Don't buy silver color. performance is good. And 8gb ram work as 16gb.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I didn't brought this Mac book but I swear I been wanting this from 4 year this thing is actually very good.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Just received the macbook pro space grey 2020 Model. This is the higher spec model with core i5 10th gen processor and 16 GB Ram.  I was coming from an early 2015 Macbook air and thought that this is the right time to upgrade. The key points that compelled me to upgrade to this new macbook pro vs the macbook air retina 2020 and macbook pro base 2020(8th gen processor) 1. i5 10th gen processor with excellent heat rejection. This will enable the macbook to endure heavy loads for longer periods of time. 2. 16 GB Ram. Will help in multitasking smoothly and also future proofing mac for atleast 6-7 yrs without any performance compromises 3. 2 additional USB C ports for flexibility and convenience. You can plug the charger on either side of the macbook. My previous charger wire broke down due to continuous bending at the same position. This proved to be a very convenient feature for me. Also it will help in simultaneously connecting more peripherals like External HDDs, Monitors, keyboards and Mouse 4. The touchbar is just amazing. Pretty thought of feature with wide range of customisations 5. Improved speakers (good base and loudness) with respect to air 2020 and macbook pro base model. You will not need an external speaker with this.  After using for a day looks like the battery performance is just equal to my previous macbook air (6-7 hrs of web browsing and video playback). Despite two cooling fans, It gets a little heated up sometimes. Also it is only slightly heavier than my previous macbook air, So I don’t think my portability has been compromised. Instead the actual physical dimensions are quite small as compared to the macbook air for the same 13.3 screen size In my opinion one should only go for it if you can afford it, else stick to macbook air 512 gb as there is a whopping 50k difference between the two. The Macbook air will also get the general work done except for some extremely heavy tasks."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Good laptop for work, battery backup is fine. I think the screen could have been more Bezel-less. Everything else is fine."

Inspiron-Display-Laptop-i5-1135G7-D560438WIN9SE,laptop,"This is a very good buy, it gives you a decent 11th gen i5 chip with 4 cores with base freq. 2.40 GHz (max freq 4.20). If you're going to use it for business purpose (coding and multiple chrome tabs), might get the ram upgraded to it's full capacity (16 GB). Otherwise 8 GB is cool for personal use.  Just be aware that only if you're lucky enough, you'll get the backlit keyboard and fingerprint scanner. Sadly, I didn't get any of these with my buy.  Furthermore it has Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics which is inbuilt on the chip and is actually better than the dedicated entry level graphics provided by NVIDIA. The system under normal load uses the on chip graphics only.  Make sure to get the factory image of the system first in your external HDD or USB before connecting to internet during initial setup. It'll be helpful when you least expect it to be ;)  If you're in confusion over HP and Dell, go to Dell, it'll give comparatively less heating and battery issues in the near future."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,"Omg! What a beast performer and what a beauty. That subtle body is so soothing. That fingerprint reader is so damn fast. Good implementation of soft touch material in the palm resting area near the touchpad. Even extended warranty along with premium care is so cheaper yet better than HP counterpart.  Only thing is I wish the machine had auto backlight keyboard timeout i.e. it doesn't automatically turn off the backlit keyboard after some time. If it's on, it will stay on till the laptop goes into sleep. It's okay, it doesn't matter to me.  The best thing is that the weight distribution and the vents have been done so well on this device, that it feels lighter than even a 14 inch laptop and doesn't ever gets hot.  P.S. beast devices need beast care. Purchase extended warranty along with premium care for this device from Amazon (TPS Technologies) and you can breathe in peace as the extended warranty is directly provided by Lenovo.  Overall, it's the best Value for Money device I could have got at this price range. Thank you Lenovo and Amazon ( for delivering within a day and understanding my urgency). Love ❤️"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,"Likes: Intel 11gen processor - lightning speed. DDR4 16GB RAM at peak speed. Wifi 6. Very fast boot up. Great battery - approx 8 hours. Fingerprint login - fast and secure. Comes with MS-office license. Front facing speakers and hence unhindered good sound. Backlit keyboard with separate numpad (like desktop keyboard) Dislikes: Lenovo apps - would have preferred clean windows. Though no noticeable hindrance from these. Would prefer separate keys for Home, End, Pgup and Pgdn instead of clubbing with Fn+arrow keys for these; though manageable with same keys in numpad."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,"I'm reviewing the product after using it for 1 week. So no idea about long term usage or customer care service. Pros: Performance: 16GB RAM is more than enough. You can't think more of this. It's damn fast. I tested it by working with 30 apps simultaneously. It worked very smoothly. Also thanks to the latest 11th gen i5 processor. The Boot Speed is also awesome. Thanks to SSD. Overall I'm quite fascinated with the performance of the CPU. Graphics: Decent for your everyday work. It has Intel's Iris Graphics Card. (Not recommended for gamers) Speakers and Microphone: Both are nice. Good bass and quality. But it's not so loud. For proper sound you always need to have max volume. It could have been better and more powerful. Microphone has a decent noise cancellation system. Keyboard: The quality of the keys are very nice. Contains backlit keyboard. It has separate number pad keys which is very useful. The keyboard arrangement is very good. Battery: On standby it gives 8hrs of battery life. Meanwhile for me, on average online classes it gives at least 3hrs of battery. Fingerprint Reader: Quite decent. No less than a mobile's fingerprint scanner. Opens up instantly. Charging: It supports rapid charging. Takes around 1hr to charge the laptop completely, which is very good. Display: It has a 15.6 inches FHD IPS anti-glare screen, which is decent. The size of the screen is more than enough, it seems bigger than you imagine. It has very narrow sided bezels which increases the screen size ratio. Smoothly runs 8k videos. Average resolution is also good. Lenevo's inbuilt features and tips and tricks are quite good. Has useful shortcut function keys. System customisation features are decent. The thing that I found interesting is that as soon as you open the laptop it switches on automatically. You don't have to press the power button. This feature is known as Flip Switch. You can turn it off in the settings. Doesn't have any bloatware or pre-installed apps. Comes with the Microsoft Office 2019 package. Cons: Camera: Could have been better. It has 0.9mp and the picture resolution is average. Not a good camera. Doesn't look good during online meetings. Doesn't support HDR, 12K resolution, Windows Hello. Battery: When the battery is very low, like 10%, it drains very fast. Battery conservation is average. Touchpad: Average. Sometimes it doesn't recognise your finger gesture. A little high sensitivity. Non Upgradable: You can't add additional RAM sticks or Graphics Card because it's already soldered onto the motherboard."

Laptop performance is very good. Price can be something in early 60k. But it's ok as we see there is hike in the market for all laptops Many hot keys makes my life simpler, like calculator sniping volume controls etc Though it looks sleek, it's bit heavy to hold. Overall good to have personal laptop.  I didn't use it for gaming so no views on that"

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,"Really loved the display and graphics, and the responsiveness of the finger print reader. Backlit keyboard makes it easier to use it anywhere - light or dark. Good buy."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,"Good screen and graphics, fingerprint reader works absolutely fine, light weight and good performance for office related work!! The best laptop purchase in the last 5 years."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,"Hi , I have bought the laptop offline at the price of 65K. The laptop performance is good. The only concern is its RAM is soldered to the mother board. If in case, of any issue or failures then we don't have an option to repair it and the laptop becomes useless and void. Not sure if any guidance on this let me know"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,"This laptop is a beast, I cannot even begin to explain the happiness of seeing the 16GB RAM at work. Its unbelievable how the performance of the laptop has changed. The build quality is great with an awesome 15.6 FHD IPS display with great brightness. The sound quality is great with Dolby. Even though the laptop is 15.6 inch, the laptop is very light and easy to carry around. I am absolutely delighted with the purchase of this laptop. Very very happy with the purchase. Go ahead and blindly go for this product. Nothing else can beat this value per performance of this machine."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0125IN,laptop,lenovo laptops have very poor performance. within 2 months of purchase its hard disc stopped functioning and the customer care never bothered to replace. even its camera was not functioning properly . so better avoid this brand.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Great product in the long run
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Ordered this laptop y'day and got it delivered today (too quick). The initial impression is very good as even with plastic build, the laptop looks slim & feels premium. I would have preferred a darker colour but didn't had a choice so can't complain on it. Now on the product: 1. The keyboard is very responsive and easy to use. Sound is good (not much loud though). Backlit option would have been great :-( 2. Display is impressive and fulfils my need for a 15.6 inch view. 3. Packaging was basic with an adapter (haven't used yet...it came with 70% charge) and a thin paper manual. 4. Setting it up was a breeze but took a long time to download and install all updates - usual pain with new laptop/mobile. 5. It comes with Windows 10 pre installed and Office (H&S) which needs to be activated. 6. Till now response and performance is awesome. Tried opening Youtube videos, website, files and few games (asphalt and sniper).... everything was a breeze. Been using an i7 laptop since last 2 years and found speed /response to be comparable...but too early to give the crown here. 7. Now the most IMP part: A newly launched Product from a reputed manufacturer HP having this combo of Ryzen 5500/ 8GB RAM/ 512 GB SSD/ Win10/ Office/ 15.6 display under 50K is a STEAL. Got this Beauty at 46.5k (including all offers & CB) so very Happy. You won't find any laptop with similar config for less then 52k currently. If you are on the fence then don't wait, blindly get this beast which is capable of most of the task you can imagine (except hardcore gaming)"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"One of best available in the 8GB, 512 SSD, 50k price range. Good to go if you like a larger screen than a typically preferred 14"" screen."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Following are specs features Pros Ryzen 5000 series process (latest) Ram is 3200MHz (faster than 2666MHz) SSD is nvme USB C port Good build quality 15 inch display Cons No Backlight keyboard Wifi is 5 instead of 6 Bluetooth is 4 instead of 5 USB A is 2.0 instead of 3.2 No Ethernet RJ45 port Display is SVA instead of IPS I experienced following things Laptop boot quickly Speaker are loud Keyboard and trackpad are of good quality. Currently examining more features... Edit Display is not good but this is cost cutter Viewing angle require perfection to view Battery backup is great it is due to 7nm processor File transfer is fast with type c but normal I use USB A port so normal speed Ram management is good Run emulators and preimer pro after effect photoshop Lightroom autocad visual studio all running good but not compare it with i7/16gb Overall best laptop One star deducted due to diplay quality
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"I'm using this device for web & mobile app development. Overall great experience, great performance. I installed Manjaro onto it, which took 1.5 minutes to complete, which is amazing. Only thing is, I installed Network Driver (Realtek on Linux) on my own. It worked fantastic. With full charge, I get 15 hours of battery life (keep in mind that I'm using Linux). The keyboard looks like it has backlight, but it doesn't. I researched online, but none of them made the backlight work which is the only problem as of me. Display is good, audio quality is acceptable. You can run Android Studio smoothly, which tells everything ;) To conclude, it gets the work done. You can seamlessly build Web Applications and Flutter Apps(along with Virtual Device). If you are a Developer, Just go for it. If you are a content creator, you edit the videos without any hastle, but don't expect flagship level rendering(but it does it's job well)."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Display quality low. Touchpad one side small .Stay away from this seller. Keys not well mounted.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,good product inth8s price ranges. very very nice product.according to me this the best laptop for it b.teach student.go for it.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"After using this product for one week, here's my review of this: Display : 4/5. It's not ips, but does the job perfectly. Impressed. Battrey: 5/5. Easily 5 hr backup, charges is 1.5hr Performance: ryzen 5500 is beast. No lag till date. Good performance Heat: 4.5/5,no heating issue. After 2 hr of continuous usage, it heats little. But that managable. Every processer have that issue. Quite normal. Storage: no extra slot, but 500gb can be replaced to 2tb. Memory: 8 gb, expandable to 16 gb. Built: 3/5, not a rough and tough laptop. Build is just average. Plastic made. No backight keyboard. But it's managable. Just justify its price. Not too great, not too bad. Price: 5/5.best vanlue for money. Ovearall: 4.5.good laptop at this price point. Surely recommend. Bought at 49000 on may 2021.thumbs up."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,You cant see letters... Grey paint on silver background... Worst idea... How can a big company do this stupid thing... And also it don't have backlit keyboard. Its too hard to type .. can't see a key properly... And beware of display.... It doesn't look good.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Cons: No Backlit Keyboard. Average build.  Pros: Rest all is great.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Perfect for office work. I have no issues with this product. Totally satisfied. Build is premium. Keyboard and trackpad are of great quality. Screen is okay at this price. Sound is crisp, clear n perfectly loud. Webcam is like all other laptop (dont expect crystal clear video from it). Performance is the no. 1 highlight of this laptop. At this price a 5th gen ryzen 5500u (even though built on Zen2 Architecture) is more than any1 can ask for. Extremely snappy and fast program opening speeds. U can bet on it. Go ahead and experience it urself. Ps - I have no use of a backlit keyboard coz i bought this to use in my office with ample lights."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"The looks touch nd feel is premium for sure...light weight , but u will find the performance of system and battery life to be pretty average nd somewhat disappointing considering price point of almost 50k..... Not a gaming laptop by any means.....but can can play some light games .... For students and wfh purpose...on paper specs looks descent....win10 msoft office 512 ssd no hdd 15.6 inch display fhd and antiglare...no backlit keyboard...ryzen 5 5000 series processor.....still feel the value u get ...is around 40 k but we are paying 10k extra for HP brand"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Just got the laptop y'day. Useful tip: wait for Appario retail to stock it because they give a lower price.  The product is advertised as 15s-eq2040u but the HP software installed tells it is 15-ef2000! So there is some mis-selling there? See the attached image.  Looks sleek - its not light, but its big screen and is built to a price with plastics, so that's expected.  The display is very average, but I kind of expected that. Still its FHD, so that's good. Its got a matte look - which might be the anti-glare coating? Not impressed.  It boots from sleep by the time you open the lid fully, and from hibernate in 8 seconds - very nice.  The RAM can be doubled to 16GB which makes it a bit future proof, especially as the RAM is shared by the built-in graphics processor."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Microsoft Office Home & Student not installed as assured activation key not provided.  Cheap, poor build quality used for body doesn't look like 50k system.  Battery backup is poor.  Heating very quickly, not suitable for gaming.  Don't buy if your preference is gaming or editing etc.  Can play games on low settings.  Screen colour accuracy is not good.  Overall not satisfied with the product, performance, build quality, using it since last two months."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"The power button was not working properly. When i click on the power button it is not turned on. The. I thought the laptop has no charging and incorrect it to charging cable, then it turned on and battery was 89%. Why did it not turn on ? It happend 2 times in 4 days. i have decided to return it back and i have not got replaced the device isntead they refunded me. Well i have to search again for someother laptops and all my effort to find the hp laptop was useless."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,All things are good but trust me guys you should not trust the display...I have been facing display flickering issues while I am playing any kind of videos. My desires to watch movies and series just went airways... Also the hp assistant wasted my 3 hours misguiding me downloading unnecessary updated and even after re installing windows I lost all my data..and finally congratulations on the fact that now display flickers even without playing any video
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Laptop is good. No lag so far. If you are are spoiled by good amoled or ips screen, you will be disappointed. This is sva panel. 14 inch has ips could have better screen than 15 inch one 14 inch also has backlit keyboard and same battery capacity 41WH."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"While on hibernate laptop still remains warm. So battery will drain overnight. Tried all possible solutions under power settings, nothing helps. Wifi disconnection is frequent, 1-2 daily. Once disconnected, for sometime wifi will not detect any network.  Generally laptop build quality is cheep. Made of full plastic and feels fragile. I am scared screen might damage if you close-open lid frequently. Keyboard also feels cheap.  Sound quality is good. Ryzon 5 5500 performs well. CPU and GPU speed is good.  Really bad experience with this HP laptop."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"I upgraded from an HP probook 440 g4 so this feels like a Macbook in my hands! Totally value for money  Pros: - The screen is awesome especially when I compare it to my previous laptop, 15.6 inch and not reflective at all, very clear. But you have to view it from the correct angles (how you use a laptop normally) which is fine because nobody uses a laptop looking at the screen sideways or from downwards - The battery life is amazing, lasts anywhere between almost 8h to 12h even when watching videos - The CPU is very nice and latest gen, multitasking is a breeze - The ssd makes it boot up in 2 seconds, I used to wait 4 mins for my previous laptop - You can even play some old games, sims 3 works very smoothly on Medium settings but of course as vram is only 512 mb so can't play intensive games - Build quality is good  Cons - The storage might seem less and I don't think you can upgrade it or add an hdd, but this is easily solved by getting an external affordable hard drive for storing items - The dual speakers, while pretty loud, aren't the best quality in terms of clarity, but still pretty good for laptop speakers - The keyboard is not backlit, and the grey paint on silver colour makes it hard to see the keys. Solve this by getting a keyboard cover from Amazon for some 400 rupees, they come in very nice colors and protect keyboard from dust - The webcam is average, not full HD clear  Overall I would say get this laptop if this is your budget, without a doubt. It's very good for coding, studying, virtual meetings, entertainment and light gaming, and HP service is usually very good."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Very nice laptop . GO for it!! It has ryzen 5 processor which is very good But no backlit keybord
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Boot up in max. 10 seconds, shut down is in 2-3 seconds. The configuration is worth and it does processing very fast. Compared to my earlier Dell PC (4G ram with i3 10th gen processor), it is at-least 4-5 times faster. Superbly better than the dell and I am totally satisfied with this HP laptop. It's worth and I recommend buying it -- though NOT as a gaming PC. It does most of my normal stuff without lagging/slowness in response."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Super impressed with the performance thos laptop delivers,the new ryzen 5 5500U processor delivers that with ease. I ran Valorant on this lap and it delivered constant 60fps without fail.Also got 10 hrs of battery backup with light work. The oly thing that needs improvement is the screen,There is a bit of light bleeding around the edges.Overall an amazing buy under 50k"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"The Laptop is worth its money due to the latest AMD 5000 series processor with 6 (2.1Ghz each) core & 12 threads that helps in numbers crunching processing power.  You can also run many editing and Programming softwares seamlessly without any Lag or bottleneck.  The best part in this laptop is options for upgrading the RAM upto 16Gb and Hard drive upto 2TB! You can also upgrade it to Windows 11  You could smoothly play games such as PUBG, Far-Cry, GTA in low settings. Battery life might be affected due to higher consumption.  The only Cons on this laptop is it's display and no LAN port."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"I have ordered this laptop on 18th may, it had some dents even though Amazon package was good. But Hp package had small holes (approximately 0.5 cm2) with these holes laptop body got two small dents of 2mm2 and 1 mm2. For which I have contacted customer service they readily agreed to replace the laptop and replacement order received today i.e 30/05/2021. Now I have fully configured the laptop and battery is good. Overall good experience at 45k."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Beautiful display and beautiful design.. Build quality is good... Laptop is fast..... But one con.... Viewing angel which watching video is not good.... You not able to watch video even you silently change your angle
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Pros Very good performance Upgradable ram Awesome and loud speaker Normal battery backup Cons Display lacks viewing angles. Need to look straight No backlight keyboard
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Display screen in description is sva but It was a low quality tn panel display images got dark and fade and view angles are also bad . If you want a good screen laptop this laptop is not for you .dont buy this laptop it has only a good processor and nothing else no backlit keyboard no finger print sensors , no graphic, and has a plastic build . also amazon dont return/refund this product unless you find a major defect  I recommend you to enhance your budget upto 60k go for dell or asus and make sure laptop has a ips antiglare display"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"I've ordered it on last week, sold by appario retail private ltd, everything is fine, but the laptop has issue with keyboard, one key was not working, issue was intermittent, so I contacted Amazon then they arrange for return. So my advice is please do check the laptop thoroughly, don't blindly believe in QC sticker."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Like: 1. Build quality 2. Keyboard, Screen 3. Light weight 4. Fast processing  Dislike: It's been only 2 days I bought it. But keyboard back lit should have been there."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Worst display.. Don't buy it
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Disappointed with this purchase. Within one and a half month laptop's display went dark right in the middle of work. I have reported the issue (Case Number 5069042865). It's a hardware problem and requesting for a new laptop in exchange as it falls well within warranty.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"This laptop is good but not best at the price . U can go for hp14sfq1030au model which has better screen and backlit keyboard too. But if 15.6 inch is imp for u then u can definitely go for it,it will not let u down. U can do occasional gaming editing and every type of coding stuff. Also on battery life which is 6hrs max i got. Wifi connectivity is fast. But tge camera is very poor. Build quality good but what can u expect from plastic build"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"That color rendering on the display could have been better, but this is what we can expect in a midrange laptop I guess. Overall performance barring that brillant with and additonal 8 gb added on"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Best thin and light laptop you can get in this price range. Pros: 5000 series processer...ssd makes Laptop pretty fast..booting in just 5-6 seconds Cons: Screen is not good..I'm seeing some yellow tint always..its because this is not a IPS panel  Again processer because 5500U is still zen 2 architecture not the latest zen 3.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,I like.. everything is good except the keyboard back light.. there is no keyboard backlight. I feel thats the only drawback in this model. Other than that perfoemace and portability is wonderful
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Really nice product from HP. No heating. Nothing. Working fine. Only con is the webcam quality.

HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"After 1 month research, i bought this Ryzen 5500 powered HP laptop @50k. Its 7nm technology and SSD made it very fast. Battery life is above expection 10-14hrs if you do office works. Only demerit is that it has 2 usb ports"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,To satisfying laptop in this price 👍. Backlit keyboard is not there in Ryzen 5th generation processing is not fair but overall it's a better choice now at this price 😊

HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,One of the button in keyboard is uneven
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,Good
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  The display is good however it is va but with anti glare its awesome, if you use to sit on table and work, then its for you.You can chill out also(netflix). I bought it for programming and it is very good in terms of performance. You can do a bit of gaming also. Pros: Ryzen 5000 series process (latest) Ram is 3200MHz (faster than 2666MHz) SSD is nvme 512 gb upgradeable upto 2 tb USB C port as input Good build quality 15.6 inch display Cons: Wifi is 5 instead of 6 Bluetooth is 4 instead of 5 USB A is 2.0 instead of 3.2 No Ethernet RJ45 port  I experienced following things: Laptop boot quickly Speaker are loud Keyboard and trackpad are of good quality. Currently examining more features..."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,This a a classy laptop slim look loved it ... you can go for it ♥️🤗good for new users. Look is very nice ....battery is also lasting for more than 7 hrs till now its working ...  The above was my first day experience but now I found some problems .... tye battery drains quickly in zoom meeting 2 hrs meeting and the battery goes from 100 to 40/30 .... and also it is heating very easily.
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"The laptop is great. It's the only laptop with Ryzen 5 5th Gen processor under 50 k as of now (May 2021) and I needed a good processor.  It's screen is a little iffy, and the build quality could have been sturdier, but it does quite well otherwise.  Even without a graphic card you can play games with good performance. Played CS:GO with all the graphics set to high, and I got around 35-50 fps even 60 some times. But the average would be around 40 fps and mode would be around 37 fps.. so that's quite impressive.  Anything processor intensive will be shredded with 6 cores and 12 threads, so will definitely suffice for office work."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,1. Very fast 2. good battery backup 3. No heating issue  Disadv  1. Display is not that good. you have to sit straight to get a good visibility 2. no backlight display
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"I am reviewing this product after 7 days of use and Everything is going good till now. I think this laptop is best laptop under 50k and even under 55K. *Brand name Hp is enough to tell you about durability and quality, you will get. * Some buyers are complaining about the display but I didn't feel any major difference between IPS panel and SVA one. Viewing angles are good enough. *The best thing about the laptop is Ryzen 5 5500U with Radeon graphics. This processor makes this laptop to perform Multitasking smoothest ever in a 50K laptop. So if Performance is your primary concern, than go and buy this * YES, you can play games like GTA V , It will not heat up that much.  * Last and best thing is Looks. Looks are KILLER. Build Quality is also nice (considering this comes under 50k). And this weighs only 1.5 Kg.  * Essence is if you want a allrounder laptop, in which you can do multitasking, gaming, Coding, Editing. Than This is currently the Best option in the market. Bcz none other Pc gives you this much all rounder performance, It can Game, Edit and can do many more things without lag.  SO Stop thinking and go for this."
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It does its work absolutly fine. I will not complain about any game or high end editing as this is office laptop. I saw someone mentioned that they received bag but its not correct. Please be noted that you will receive laptop, charger and a manual inside the box. This comes with a good packaging so there were no damage on this. Overall this was good experience. Now I will use my laptop for daily office use and see if this is as mentioned on papers or somewhere behine those specifications.  If you were about to buy a buy a laptop within 50K then you can surely go for this. Before getting this gadget, I was about to buy MI Horizon i5 that was about 50K and with card offers it was on 47K and on the other hand I was also looking forward to buy Acer aspire 7 AMD 5500U which was not deliverable at my pin. So I finally choose to buy a laptop from Hp. The brand is enough to protect you and grantee a long lifelife.  Missing metal body, backlit keyboard"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"First of all, the latest Hexa core Ryzen processor works like a charm. No heating or hanging even after running full day. Good for day-to-day work/programming. Don't expect gaming as no dedicated graphic card. 8 GB RAM is good enough but you can upgrade with 16 GB. The screen is ok not top-notch as expected. Build quality should have been better. Go for it if you want non-heating laptop with latest processor and budget is ~50k"
HP-Laptop-15-6-Inch-Windows-15s-eq2040au,laptop,"Quality lap, but the price of this lap in hp site is much less not sure why it's costly in here. Gamers don't go for this"
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Purchased this Laptop last week and not happy with performance. Cons 1. Booting issue. It takes long time to open in spite of latest BIOS version updated 2. Takes long time to load any apps/browser. Very slow 3. Battery backup is very poor. Hardly lasts for 1.5 hours after 100% charge 4. This laptop is made out of China and comes with hardly very cheap manual of just 2 or pages sheet. Doesn't look Dell quality. I didn't expect that such cheap product from Dell
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Ordered this product from amazon as dell categories this model under business and delivery time is 1 month. So went with high end config of I5, 11th Gen, 8GB mem and 1TB HDD but it was very shocking package received was damaged and box was already opened or used. The performance of the product is very poor and it take long time to show-up the login screen and any application performance is very bad. Also extending the dell warranty is nightmare as there is no response from Dell for this product finally the quote was quite higher than the original purchase E.g if you order thru dell extending additional 2 year of warranty is around 1999 but if you do it separate it cost around 5000 . So purchased additional 500GB of WD NVME and made the system boost ending up spending 55k for this product without extended warranty which is quite expensive for this model"
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"I received a faulty laptop first, then I spoke with Amazon executive and they helped me to get an another one as replacement ""Thanks Amazon"". It's been less than a week since i have been using this laptop, so far i don't see any issues and works fine as described & expected. The battery backup is very good and look wise also it's good."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"The laptop provides a good specification but they are really cheap and inefficient. To consider an example the Core i5 11th generation performs poorly than a Core i5 8th generation. The HDD also performs really bad especially while booting. The booting time varies between 2 mins to 5 mins. That's too long considering the pace of technology and the price of the product, almost 50k. It's sad that Dell is producing cheaper thousands of cheaper, worthless variants in the market rather than used to have a couple of awesome variants in past. So, be careful while buying, and DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. ** Also Amazon.in has a bad return policy and they won't take it back."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"My daughter has been using it from last few week for her online classes. The laptop have only 1 drive which is HDD so boot time is little longer. Otherwise every thing is working fine.The build quality is good,trackpad function is smooth. The body has a mat finish and give an elegant look. 14 inch screen,11th generation intern core i5. This was the cheapest model with above configuration ."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Good features quite fast battery backup is also sufficient and enough. Can be a better option for anyone below 50k
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Very slow to boot up and also slow while loading applications, frequent firmware updates(every two days) and have done at least 3 times since I bought it in a space of one week. The laptop shows a blank dark screen after reboot and then i need to shut down and restart again multiple times. Frustrated after a week's use and returning the product."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,This product makes too much noise if the fan which is strange as well as there is no easy replacement policy of this product. When I asked to replace it within 7days they asked me to schedule technician visits instead of replacement or return .
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Not worth money. The laptop didn’t boot up after 4 long hrs of installation. The product will only be replaced & no returns accepted and every time after replacement the customer should pay installation charges which costs around 800 bucks. Ideal to buy expensive items at authorised stores.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,The system speed is extremely slow. I made a complaint on 25th Feb. I was told that system will be replaced within 48 hours. It is already more than one week but my system has not been replaced.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Laptop performance is very bad. Restart takes more than 25mins. Was excited when received it but unhappy with the product. Wasted my one weeks time waiting for it. Returning it.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Dont buy it, waste Rs50000 .  Key board is hard and i think they have give used laptop for me. This model is not at all good. See product they have not shared clear front images purposely."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Poor quality and never advised for this product. With the same cost lots of peer companies give good quality product.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,This doesn't seems to be i5 . Very very slow ...without any application it's slow like this what will happen when I will install other applications and software
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"It is good laptop, but a little costly than earlier purchased of same configuration."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Horrible, Nightmare, after receiving the screen went off, OS problematic, Mother Board defective. The company policy says no replacement of laptop. Stay away or buy if you really want to drain some hard earned money."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,I totally dislike the product ....It is worked properly about one week.....And then it is totally started misbehaving like very slow and Not responding any Apps....So don't buy this laptop
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,The system is good and méets the requirements.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"I like it's build quality, display,camera , but because of 1tb HDD speed is little bit slow but acceptable. Good for gaming intact higher gaming but the hot winds coming out position can be improved."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Worse Laptop I have ever seen, not worthy product even system was not fast even it's don't have any data. Don't put investment on this laptop."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Laptop speed is slow ... It's getting stuck ..taking more times for open and speed is not good ... Pls 🙏 don't purchase this laptop ..bad experience this lappi
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Nice laptop very good speed,battery backup is also very good. Good buy this laptop. Adding review after one month usr"
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Guys, please don't buy this..i3 processor is far better than this. @Dell please recall this product back ASAP"
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Laptop is compact. Right size. Worth the money
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Dnt buy this laptop, waste of money"
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Good
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,It’s creating problem every now and then. I will not buy laptops from Amazon in future.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Piece is defective. Send query for replacement.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Performance is too slow
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Its very slow
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Excellent
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Getting err on windows and disk show 100% and memory also showing 100 %.. Not upto mark. Not recommended. Choose better one
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,Waste of money. Battery backup and display lighting are very bad. Better option available in this budget. So be careful.
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"Lapton runnig very slow down, itsnot a original product, please retun this product and replace other product... its my request."
Dell-i5-1135G7-Integrated-Graphics-D552154WIN9BE,laptop,"I am writing this as my one-year warranty expires today. I spent most of the year talking to tech support because this laptop is garbage. I am writing today because, once again all the programs are hanging, a sudden black screen comes out of nowhere. This is not even fit for regular surfing. Even VS code doesn't work properly. It takes almost 8 to 14 minutes for this laptop to boot up and another 15 minutes just to hover the mouse upon boot-up. Those tech support guys tell you that you are lying and wasting their time. Guess what, I am wasting my time, indeed! Poorest tech support. Poorest problem-solving. Poorest everything. After almost seven months of listening to dell, they redirected me to Microsoft, after which my laptop was compromised of some basic-unessential start-up tasks and all that to get it to work without hanging. Is that what this i5 processor is all about? Even after that it's still not working properly. Waste 50K bucks I have ever spent. NOT JUST THIS ONE LAPTOP, DO NOT BUY FROM DELL EVER! BECAUSE THEY GOT THE WORST PEOPLE, WHO TREATS YOU VERY VERY BADLY. I WILL UPLOAD THE RELEVANT VIDEOS WHEN I CAN. DO NOT BUY FROM DELL. No Dell."
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,"This is the best laptop I've owned so far. It has amazing battery backup.. I get up to 11 hours most days, very light weight and has superb performance. I sometimes open 40-50 chrome tabs and it doesn't crash or lag.  I am not a gamer so I don't know about gaming. The screen is just perfect for watching movies. Keyboard is nice to touch and has backlight for night usage. Finger print unlock. Volume is decent for a small room. I haven't used it outdoors yet.  8 month later:  It is still going as smooth as a new laptop. I haven't found any drop in battery backup or performance. Now, I'm running out of space on the hard drive. That's the only downside. But I download too much unnecessary files too. Many of the reviews have mentioned about heating issue. I haven't faced such issues in the last 8 months. I recommend this laptop for anyone doing normal stuff like office work, movies and browsing. I've also been doing a little bit of coding and some machine learning projects on this laptop and haven't found any issues."
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,"This is one of the very few laptops that competes or is better than MacBook i3 series which is more expensive.  1. Processor : i5 - which has a good processing power and consumes less energy. For those who spend most of their time doing simple tasks and spend less time on high CPU consuming tasks, this processor is best suited.  2. Display : Colorful, Full HD - Good to watch movies, accurate colors and we can also download prime video. Iris Graphics card has inbuilt memory and also consumes less power. Not meant for gaming and also display is little reflective but negligible.  3. Battery : Depends upon usage but for normal task like browsing, mail, YouTube etc. battery will last for at least 9 - 12 hours  4. Design : Light weight - You can easily lift in one hand and simple design makes it more attractive"
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,Waah mjaa aagya..... what a beautiful laptop with so gorgeous screen. Everything is so perfect and so smooth . What a great experience.. Great work LG & thankyou very much for providing it at such a low price...
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Great laptop. Mindblowing speed. Fantastic display. Watching 4k hdr content feels bliss. Mindblowing purchase
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,Camera is very poor
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Edit: AFTER 2 WEEKS OF USE: I've attached the idle temperature on this device. I have disabled turbo boos from the BIOS as temperatures idle tend to be around 55 degrees even on Windows/Linux. It is true that the laptop lacks cooling, but it was designed to be that way. Even a Macbook air M1 hits a 100 degrees because it does not have fans and it is safe to do so, though uncomfortable to keep on your lap.  I've run powertop and cpu-autofreq to give you an idea of CPU use and live powerdraw under normal office use.  I tried gaming on it, it couldn't last more than 5 minutes on any recent game and temperatures rise to 90 degrees easily, the BIOS has been tuned to shut off the app at that point, beyond 100 degrees, the PC shuts itself down as a safety mechanism. So you won't damage your PC because it heats a lot, just that don't expect this to be anything but your long life office PC/entertainment device.  Battery life is 12 to 14 hours, maybe more on your technical skills and how you can tune your BIOS which is amazing, it's originally developed by Carnegie Melon University.  Display is great, speakers are good, Camera is worse than my dad's old Nokia n73 from 2007, it's just plain bad. I picked up my 1.6KG HP Probook and it felt like it was 5 times heavier than the Gram! I've updated the RAM to 16GB, it's 3200 Mhz CL22, though to be honest, this laptop will never use it cause that much load will make the device uncomfortable to use it.  Pro tip: Take the laptop to the LG service center, they did it for free, I brought my RAM stick, very helpful and quick, in 15 minutes, it was all done and I still get my international warranty for 3 years!  If you are a linux user like me, the only con is that the fingerprint reader is by goodix who outright refuses to make linux drivers for the fingerprint. DOn't expect that to work, Apart from that, this laptop is kickass in every aspect when compared to Windows 10. You might want disable turbo, you ain't going anywhere with a turbo boost on this device, do yourself a favor and disable it from the BIOS and enjoy the marathon battery life with the speed and stability of Linux.  So far, I have tried, Ubunut 20.04, SOlus 4.3, Garuda Linux, Elementary OS, Debian BUllseye RC2, Pop OS 21.04, MC Linux 19.4 and Fedora Silverblue The 4.19 kernel of DEBIAN 10 does not boot, it's too old, everything else is new and works flawlessly, just make sure you configure swap to allow hibernate.  Why this laptop is worth it with respect to the competetion: The keyboard is better than a Macbook It has backlighting The trackpad is good The design and build is premium Amazing after sales service!  Why not go for it: Forget Gaming Web Cam is terrible, my 6 year old HP Probook has a better camera. If you want to use Fingerprint on Linux"
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,"The thing I like the most about this device is the screen, I'm in love with it. And the glass trackpad is wonderful. It can play 4K videos easily. And the form factor, it's amazing. Now things that I don't like about this is the lack of second fan, it heats up and reaches temperatures of over 90°C when idling which is definitely not good. The keyboard has good travel but it feels a bit rigid. You will not get used to the keyboard instantly. The camera is there for the sake of it. The quality is questionable. In an attempt to bring the weight down they have used very thin metal sheets. It's not sturdy. And I know it's a compromise for its light form factor. Another thing I hate is the presence of glossy screen instead of matte finish. Otherwise it's very sleek and looks amazing."
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,Pros: Light weight like a magazine. Display good for Design and Photoshop Work. Fast Charging C-Type Thunderbold.  Cons: Battery maximum 11-12 hours for usual web and photoshop. Good. But expected 15 Minimum.
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,"If you are thinking to buy this laptop , pls go for it . Everyone says that we have to sacrifice performance to get this thin laptop. But I don't think so , this laptop is awesome , I ran Adobe premiere Pro , after effects , Adobe audition and it ran perfectly fine . I was able to edit a 25min 5k footage with a ease . And the graphics Intel iris plus is the best you can get on this thin laptop , never go for a gaming laptop because the fan of gaming laptops and the graphic card is useless after 1 year of use , it's mine own experience. My wordict , just go for this laptop ."

Display is very good in terms of brightness and accuracy 4. Battery is ground braking hit as it's LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG battery life. Morning start, ends Night without a need to charge 5. Fan is so smooth. I am not even feel the vibration. Heating is not a major issue for low and medium usage 6. Keyboard is luxurious. Clicks feels like HEAVEN 7. Affordable price tag! Bonanza!!! 8. Reader mode is best in class that helps to filter blue rays and help to avoid eye strain 9. LG Control Centre offers best in class features to modulate and control the system  Summary: To get a mid price range Luxury laptop this is your only best. I have a long history of searching laptop of my choice. Dell Inspiron 13 5301 and LG Gram 14 are my final choice. Comparing the both LG hit likes. So I bought it with lot of doubts. Now all doubts are far gone.  Undoubtedly the best class laptop!!!"
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,"Extremely happy with my product. Nothing abnormal to point as regards shipping & genuineness of the product. Ordered on 26th July on Amazon. Received from Appario retails, Ludhina on 29th July. Intial check of any tempering with packet done. Product checked for any marks, scratches etc. to ascertain possible previous usage. None found. Product found in brand new condition. During 29th & 30th checked to see installation, varify genuineness of windows 10 with Microsoft etc. Also registered the warranty with LG.com. All happened smoothly. Many thanks to Amazon & Appario Retails."
LG-Ultra-Light-14-inches-Thunderbolt-14Z90P-G-AJ55A2,laptop,"It's super lightweight laptop. Keep in mind, carrying a heavy laptop is no problem for me and I usually prefer big keyboards. However, just handling a lightweight laptop like this makes you feel superhuman.  The matte finish means that annoying oil stains can be removed easily. This is a plus since, I do tend to clean once a week or so to remove any stains.  Lastly the battery. It's nothing to write home about, even though they claim it has the largest battery. It's one of those advantages you'll get too used to after you buy it. However, it'll not annoy you frequently to charge, which is a great plus. It allows me to disconnect and move around when I don't have enough charge to get a better location for WiFi even on say 5-10 percent battery.  The cons probably is the cost and replacement issue. Will write about it when I get there. But with 3 year warranty, that shouldn't be an problem."

Even charging takes minimal time maybe 10 - 15 mins. 2. Super lightweight ( I feel my MacBook heavy now). 3. Powerful and fast. Check the spec, not for gaming but for daily use like work, studies it's perfect, it's an ssd laptop. Cons : sorry I can't find any fault with this laptop. Maybe when i carry you don't feel a thing and that's when i panicked if I've forgotten my laptop or not. Conclusion : after owning this laptop for 2 yrs I feel, you can't go wrong with this laptop for a normal usage. Buy it if you need one, and feel the premium. All the best."

Shutown time is around 2 to 3 seconds. With ryzen 3 4300 it cam easily beat ryzen 5 3500 though it has only 4 threads whereas ryzen5 3500 is with 8 thread. It has godd camera quality and battery backup....will update more after using it for few days... If your budget is 41000 then u can easily go for fr1029 as it have ryzen3 5300u for multitasking...and if ur budget is around 38000 then clearly go for this without any doubt...as it will clearly beat many benchmark..."

HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,Well I was looking for laptop under 40k as there were many laptops in this budget but all were coming with old processors. And they were not worth the price.  finally after many months hp have started selling newly launched laptops. This one is of 4000 series which was launched in 2020 and recent one is 5000 series which is launched in 2021. And you get 5000 series hp laptop ryzen 3 5300u in 41k on Amazon it was out of stock so I ordered this.. but still seems good decision. 3k i will spend on accessories or for extended warranty.  Talking about laptop it boots up really quick because of SSD feels like you kept it on sleep mode and started it😂  I was confused about 15inch screen or 14 but 14 inch is more comfortable to carry and screen is enough.. it's ips panel so you can watch 4k videos easily..  This processor is comparable with ryzen 5 3500u so you can say this one is better in terms of value for money..  I have not done any gaming on this but I am gonna try GTA V in this will write detailed review about it after using it for atleast month.. but till now I believe I have made good choice buying this laptop
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,"Very happy. I received laptop on 6th May. I had bit doubt on processor while ordering but actually it is fast than I expected. It takes 4-5 seconds to power on and off. Installation of softwares is quick with ssd. Screen was good. Keyboard and mouse pad is smooth. But I feel slight heat at the time of installation of some softwares. This is suitable for students, daily use and office work not for gamers. Finally a good product. Worth for money."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Purchased this laptop around 2months back and now problem started. Button F4(Projection) and button ""P"" is working automatically because of that Project window is opening and blinking automatically and whenever its opening you need to click on screen to close that and whenever I am trying to type any thing in browser or notepad ""pppppppppppppppppppppppp"" this is happening....believe me its very irritating. Return window for this product is already closed on 13th May so now I have to go to service center to short this out. This review writing took 15-20min instead of 4-5min because I had to click on the screen more than 50 times to close the 'project' window. Attached the 5sec video & photo of the issue."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,"A descent laptop for descent activities - Display is of class..!! - Combo of SSD, 8GB RAM and Ryzen is too smooth - Boot time is hardly 8sec - Wifi, Bluetooth connectivity is good - Genuine Windows 10 and MS Office - Light weight - Overall look is classy  This laptop should have been even better, if it would have following points - Keypad Backlit - Metal Build Material - Good Camera Quality - Anti Glare Display"
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,Good product. Light weight. Using from 3 weeks. Fast operations. I'm using it for online classes and it is working perfectly fine. Just one issue it does not have CD drive. Else it's a good product till now.
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,"Bought this laptop in June 2021 for everyday use and office work. This is perfect. 14 inch one is compact so easy to carry. If you want a little bit more screen space and storage go for the 15.6 inch one with 1TB hdd and 256gb ssd.  Regarding this laptop  • It's perfect for everyday use and for school and office work  • No heating issue for me, but if u use for long periods of time make sure to keep it on a proper surface so that the vents can perform properly.  • it takes less than 6 seconds to bootup or shutdown  • Has MS Office pre installed.  • Not sure about heavy gaming or editing but if you are looking for doing the office and school works and want a decent laptop with good speed go for this one.  Overall this was perfect one for me. Do consider this if for daily use"
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,"Its lightweight, beautiful, with lifetime free office and student 19. From Last 5 days I am using it with moderate work with no problems till now. Battery lasted for approx 4 hrs after full charge. Packing was great with no question of damaging enroute. For under 40k laptops it's a great buy with these specifications."
HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,"The laptop is highly portable. Comes with 8 gb 2666mhz DDR4 ram, Decent Samsung M2 512 GB SSD. 14inch FHD IPS panel. It has great viewing angles a little bit glare is there but the display is great for the price. 180° viewing angle. Office subscription needs to be activated by opening the office app and logging in. Performance is great for day to day tasks and study related task. Will update after further use. No backlight keyboard bt key travel is fine and touch pad is great. Heats less. Speakers are good a little bit lacking in bass but overall will provide good video viewing experiance. 4k is almost lag free from youtube. Radeon graphics has 512 mb VRAM and 3.7gb of shared memory from RAM."

HP-Processor-14-inch-Windows-14s-fr0016AU,laptop,So I bought this laptop on 11th june and guess what .. My laptop display gone within 20 days complete blackout.. I heard somewhere that hp service is one of the best service out there so I called them engineer did visit my home on 3rd of July. He inspect and find the fault and said we will replace the screen by tomorrow... And again guess what.. Today is 20th and they didn't replace anything and keep saying that your part has ordered already and it will be here soon.. I tweeted so many times and start ignoring my tweets as well. I dont knw how much time they need but because of them I lost my job.. I bought this laptop so that I can work.. Since I hv no work I dont know wht to do next. I dont know if anyone is going to read this or not but trust me I always trust hp products and I always suggest ppl around me to buy hp products.. After this experience i'll make sure that I will never gonna buy any of hp products in future I swear.

I have not tried games on it yet, but it comes with 496 MB VRAM and 4000MB total display memory. So we cant expect much. As advertised, the copy of windows and pre installed office is genuine. You just have to create an account or sign in with your existing account. In the Q&A section, its mentioned that the keyboard is backlit by a HP representative, Unfortunately its not the case. The key board is not backlit. Its difficult to type in night without a backlit keyboard.  Overall - A very good entry level laptop. It is good if you are just going to Study, run basic apps like MS office and medium games. I will post an update after trying out games"

Lenovo-IdeaPad-250Nits-Graphics-81Y4019EIN,laptop,"1) Bluetooth connection problem, not connecting properly with mobile or any other bluetooth devices  2) Both laptop and adapter over heating even for less use, and I am also not playing any games  3) Battery draining very fast"

Lenovo-IdeaPad-250Nits-Graphics-81Y4019EIN,laptop,"What i Disliked: Very Low Display Brightness. In normal indoor usage I am using 80% brightness most of time. Its very tough to use outdoors even with 100% brightness. Display colors are more towards Warmer side Speakers are just ok and not very loud enough Battery I am getting just ~ 2.5 to 3hrs, with WiFi on, browsing, streaming media  What i Loved: Premium Build Quality Looks and smooth finish Nice Resolution Great Keyboard Performance Lenovo Vantage Tool"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-250Nits-Graphics-81Y4019EIN,laptop,"I am reviewing the 8gb ram, 512gb ssd variant here.  I was bit hesitant before buying as some of the reviews saying battery backup is not so good. But after using 2 weeks I am reviewing this product. I am not gamer I use this laptop for my office work, I am impressed with the battery backup and the performance.  I am getting a battery backup of around 6 to 8 hrs. And the system boots up in just 4 secs that's very fast right. Also experience windows 10 with this laptop is an amazing experience.  One thing which impressed me very much is you don't need to press the power button to power on, just open the laptop lid it will automatically switch on. Laptop build quality is superb, there is so much room on the laptop to move your palm, keyboard is very smooth.  Only thing is in the configuration section they have mentioned that it comes with 3 USB ports but I see only 2."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-250Nits-Graphics-81Y4019EIN,laptop,"Writing this review after a month of usage. The laptop works fast when it comes to the usual applications and the battery charge stays longer than 5hrs without charging. But there is certain lag at times when using photoshop and illustrator,and hence the 4 stars.  Overall it's good but probably not the best for illustration/graphic design work."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-250Nits-Graphics-81Y4019EIN,laptop,Excellent
Lenovo-IdeaPad-250Nits-Graphics-81Y4019EIN,laptop,"This laptop is heck overpriced.. Gtx 1650 is nkt future proof and they are taking 75k for it, Get another laptop"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-250Nits-Graphics-81Y4019EIN,laptop,This laptop is really good in terms of build quality and performance is hyped by powerful core i7 10th gen processor.. this is the laptop you can use for both office and gaming purposes.. PROS : 1) Very good build quality and very good design as compared to other bulky gaming laptops all the credit goes for this goes to Lenovo 👍👍  2) Powerful processor and a dedicated GPU which serves almost all purposes… if u want to do heavy gaming better buy RTX graphics cards series not GTX  3) Good thermals and large storage  4) Very good Lenovo support after sales…  5) Great display with anti glare which is very good and best colour backlight keyboard  CONS:  1) Battery Life is compromised. You can get 4.5 hrs of battery life when browsing and attending online classes..(though I achieved 4.5 hrs of battery life by tweaking some setting in BIOS)  2) Screen is 60hz which is almost fine for everyone but higher refresh rate is preferred by some gamers..  Rest everything is good I would suggest this laptop mainly for design and build quality and for students who want to do some work and casual gaming…  But remember to upgrade to 16 Gb ram for best performance by CPU
Vivobook-M515DA-BQ512TS-Laptop-Ryzen-Windows,laptop,"Camera is way worse than I expected, my 5 year dell laptop has better camera quality than this. If you use camera often I wouldn't recommend this at all."
Vivobook-M515DA-BQ512TS-Laptop-Ryzen-Windows,laptop,Nice product. Worth the price
Vivobook-M515DA-BQ512TS-Laptop-Ryzen-Windows,laptop,Reasonable purchase
Vivobook-M515DA-BQ512TS-Laptop-Ryzen-Windows,laptop,It is worth the money you are paying best laptop under 50k should definetly buy but if you want it for gaming it is still very good in gaming
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,"i7 Processor with 16GB RAM, 32GB Intel Optane memory with Latest 512GB SSD is very impressive. This is 10gen i7 processor which has 8 Cores and 16 Threads which was only seen with i9 Laptops earlier.  Screen Quality is good and Keyboard is also better. Mainly the Touchpad is improved when compared to earlier models. GeForce 4GB graphic card with 144Hz screen combination makes every Games smoother to view.  By the way, Web Cam is VGA not expected from HP, they could have given HD web cam which is even present in i3 Laptops. VGA webcam is the only disadvantage in this device. For Online Class, we need to Buy better external Web Cam.  WEB CAM is VGA and we could expect 20 years ago quality with this Camera. Apart from Web Cam, overall hardware is better.  Laptop outer body looks like cheap plastic with Black and Purple Keyboard which is not good color combination. Speaker Quality is Average. Since this is High power device, battery backup is very low (practically we can expect only up to 25mins battery backup)  If you look for Hardware specification, please go to this Laptop. If you are looking only for the features with HD camera, Battery Backup then go for x360 models, which is really rich in features and battery backup is up to 6 hrs.  HP could have provided good Web Cam in this 1511Tx model. Anyway this model has MS Office 2019 Pre-Installed, with 144Hz Screen."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Brand New Laptop as mentioned by Amazon Seems like its 20year old machine which hangs anywhere you are at. i7 16Gb variant I have. Even simple zoom meeting, gmails, outlook kind of application not handled with this laptop...nowhere it is better. Tried updating as per FAQs on HP site and see it hanged and crashed complete. Also note the camera is literally 20year old so dnt expect anything from laptop now... Very very disappointed !! Registered complaint with Amazon and got promise of technician to visit my place to check before any further action from Amazon for refund."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,This model is next to none at this moment in the market from Pricing and performance point of view. Touch screen was not my requirement hence it does not disappoint me. Battery drains in 90 minutes if you are on a high end application or a game like FIFA. Absolutely no freebies provided. Little surprised but OK since it's performance surpasses everything. All in all a 4.5 Star.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,Just go for AMD series laptops for better gaming and editing needs.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,"It takes around 6-10 minutes to boot up , every time you shutdown the lap .. the screen freezes for 6-10 minutes ,, I don't know why this occurs but it is very annoying , so I suggest you guy's don't buy this laptop ,"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,Screen quality is not bad. But performance wise it is equivalent to entry level i9.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,Not at all good product
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,The specs are literally trash in a trash chassis which will give up after 2 years but will also server a a free heater . Idk what was going through the mind of the product management team wehn they set the price . Their victus lineup with a 3050ti is not only cheaper but also has better thermals Worst product ever by hp
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,"I purchased this machine from a HP Retail, got a better deal than Amazon. The product is awesome, though it could do a bit better in the Graphics department with a 1660 ti. Am a moderate gamer and coder, for me its good enough. You could go for DK1509TX, it has all the same specs with 120Hz screen. The 144 Hz in this one is not of any use with a 1650 Ti graphics. Anyways if you are looking for great build quality the go for it. If you want more specs, go for MSI. Also great heat sync. Decent fps on games. I am quite happy with the device. Been three weeks. You could go for a 1Tb SSD upgrade.  And this is a gaming device so dont put out much hope on battery. If you want battery, buy a Pavilion slim series, ThinkPad, or a Macbook. Gaming and battery are always enemies."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,hp trying to cover up the profit margins for victus by selling these overpriced heaters 😶 the product selling team is high AF 😪
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,"Battery backup is too low , even if it's a new product hardly it comes only 30min even after full charging"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-dk2075tx,laptop,I have never seen such a disappointment before . HP please reduce the price by 30k then it could be bearable :(
HP-255-G8-3K1G7PA-Graphics,laptop,Very good...
HP-255-G8-3K1G7PA-Graphics,laptop,It is one of the worst laptops bought by me It works so slow for even basic work You cannot even think about doing some work that requires good laptop specs
HP-255-G8-3K1G7PA-Graphics,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Best mid range laptop😎🤞🏻 No tenion Best laptop for student One seggestion 256 gb ssd put this for best performance
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Screen keeps moving back and forth even with ceiling fan on. Not satisfied with build quality. Mouse sometimes is not responding as well. Delivery from amazon was on time. Not happy putting in so much money and product being very fragile
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"Using it for over a month now. Satisfied with the purchase. Putting down the pros and cons basis my experience and personal preferences:  Pros: 1. Light weight. Looks elegant and sturdy. Outer body of screen is of aluminum. 2. Keys are well placed and feels nice to type. No key noise while typing. 3. Boot time really fast, 5-7 secs. Fingerprint works accurately. 4. Full charged battery easily lasts for 6-7 hours with normal use.. my daughters does her online classes and battery lasts for around 4+ hours easily. It takes around 1.5 hours for full battery charge. 5. Backlit keyboard with 2 different brightness levels. 6. Laptop comes with lifetime free edition of MS Office. 7. Sound is pretty loud. No complains. 8. Web cam quality is average. Neither very good nor bad. Cons: 1. Color reproduction is not nice. So this is definitely not for those whose primary requirement is colour accuracy... Like photography, content creation, graphics etc. Ok many websites, the colour of the images, icons comes out dull. I miss the sharpness and colour saturation. 2. Sharpness of text is missing. Someone else also had mentioned similar feedback. 3. There was a problem with my Bluetooth connectivity wherein it was not getting connected with phone, though was able to connect with other Bluetooth devices. Raised a complain and Lenovo team sent an engineer who replaced the wifi cum Bluetooth chip and now it works fine."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,bought this on the same day of launch. write this after 2 days of usage. amazing performance amazing battery life and everything is nice.  the only drawback for me is the missing ethernet port.  worth for 55k price range.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"I purchased this laptop thinking it would last me 7 years, when I can barely last 7 days with it. I'm a designer who needs colour accurate screens but this screen is not color accurate. The middle laptop in the photo is the lenovo laptop purchased. When I visited the lenovo centre they said that there was nothing wrong with it. The customer care of Lenovo is of no help either. They're refusing to help fix this issue and they're not even providing a denial letter so i can get my money back. I'm stuck with this product but you don't have to. Dont purchase. (other aspects of the laptop are fine, but a screen is important to me and that is something that's not getting fixed. And Lenovo's attitude towards this issue is a bummer. Dont buy Lenovo anywhere)"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"Its mentioned that there are USB 3.0 ports available are 3, but in fact only 2 are available. Could Lenovo or the seller clarify why.  Also there is no mention of whether the RAM can be expanded."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,I was looking for a light weight laptop which could provide longs battery backup. This is my first AMD Ryzen based laptop and it didn't disappoint me. With long battery backup which lasts about 8 hours on noraml office work it also have a good image and video quality. The only small thing that bother me is color accuracy on certain websites and application which is not a good experience. The laptop is not recommended to professional in image editing business.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"The laptop is fabulus. Speed is awesome, finger print sensor, weight, backlit key board and other features are also perfect. But only one thing to mention, there is only 2 USB port whereas in product specification it is mentioned 3. I have to purchase usb hub. Otherwise its a superb buy. No one is offering such specifications in this price range."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"Look is great. Build quality is sturdy. Performance is as expected. Battery backup though varies between 6-8 hrs depending on usage for the ryzen 5 5500u model....over all I am satisfied.  Also the haselfree exchange of old product made me a huge fan of Amazon unlike flipkart who were offering 1800 for same laptop after inspection, and Amazon exchanged for more than 9000"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"Sturdy build quality. 5500u performs as advertised. Audio is clear and just about loud. Setting up office-19 was a bit of a hassle given the office 365 pop-ups. Can handle gaming at medium settings. Thermal management is pretty average. For the price, still a pretty good deal."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"I have this system from last 20 days so it will be premature to comment ,but so far it works smoothly ,boot time is fast no overheating but need to work on system to provide full review.FYI it take dust particles so need to keep it clean"

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,Personally don't like d anti glare display
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,Screen quantity is not great. Rs. 500/- Amazon Pay voucher from Appario Retail not received
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"Amd ryzen 5500 performance is sufficient, battery lasts all day(8-10hrs average usage) build quality is decent display has a flex."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,Not satisfied with product First the screen brightness was not changing on first day then this irritating blue line appears on the screen
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,Excellent
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,only negatives are ram and ssd doesn't have extra slot. And display could have been better.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,All good but received defected charging adapter and now they are not replacing it.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LN00GTIN,laptop,"1. Sound is very low even your mobile phone could produce more. 2. Material quality is not good even your old laptop under 30k can be better 3. Camera quality is not suitable for video calling and classes. 4. My 9 year old laptop hp ProBook 4540s is much better in term of material, sound, and camera quality which I bought for Rs 32000.  Its cost should be under Rs 35k"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"After a lot of research across various brands, I finally landed up with lenovo slim 5. Bought it for 74k through Amazon. It was a smooth one day, no hassle delivery. Thank you Amazon for the safe packaging as well. The laptop configuration was good. It's been 2 days of usage primarily for browsing, light gaming and media streaming.  Pros: 1. Performance is good - super fast boot up and shut down, and lag free browsing. 2. No bloatwares in the laptop 3. Superb battery life. I get close to 7 hrs if not more 4. The backlit keyboard is comfortable to type and has a good build quality. 5. No heating as of now (haven't stretched it enough) 6. Wifi reception is fine (not very good, but not bad either) 7. Light weight  Cons: 1. Viewing angles are decent, but not the best 2. Speakers sound tinny (I've been spoilt with my office Mac book pro, so... ) 3. Webcam clarity is just about ok.  I'm not a hardcore gamer, but managed to play asphalt 9. It was quite good. Haven't stretched it enough to pass a verdict. So far it's been quite impressive. Shall update if I happen to come across anything significant. I feel it's a good buy."
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"Light weight, and big sized screen. Just a day OLR. So far , happy with the spec. Will update in months time"
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,Cons - The only con which i found while using is battery life. Once it's fixed then this is the best in class laptop in this range.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"The complete laptop for my choice in my budget compair to other brands and thanks to Amazon for prime day sale I bought this laptop just 64000/- actual price 71990/-,1750 hdfc instant discount,4200 emi interest waiver and 2000 cash back offer. Coming to the laptop When I purchasing time this laptop having only 3 star rated, but my configuration completely matching to this laptop,first time I purchased below 4 star rating item, but I am fully satisfied Pros : 1) Superb compact design and durable 2) light and thin 3) nice display viewing angle is ok 4) all futures are well working especially finger print 5) super fast booting 6) keypad and touchpad superb response Cons : battery backup above average I am expected more"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"Keyboard is not suitable for office work as it doesn't have dedicated keys for home, end, page up/down. Didn't notice earlier now stuck with it!"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"I am totally happy with this Lenovo IdeaPad. It runs on Intel processor and is really fast. I also got the update for the new windows 11. It is running smooth without any hangover or any kind of lags.  Sound quality is decent though not great, but definitely better than other laptops I have seen so far. Only concern is the battery back up. It runs hardly for 4 hours with the online classes. So far I am happy with its perfomance"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"I thought I am buying best configuration. But hanging issue during update and unusual heating issue is there. I have been using laptops of different brands but such an experience is for the first time with laptop. Probably, the above issues are only with this piece and may not be genuinely with the brands/model as such."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,The laptop stopped working in one month of normal office work (delivered 28th July and stopped working on 30th August). It is not powering on at all. Will update the review once this is resolved by Lenovo.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,Battery usage hours are less I think anti glare is wonderful no issue.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,Overall laptop is really good. But as mentioned in product details is available with 512GB SSD and 1 TB hard disk. When I ordered this laptop i found there is no storage of 1 TB hard disk only 512GB SSD is available. So 73k is not worth it for this Specifications.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"Battery is good, display, camera is ok, no heating issues."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"Perfect Laptop for daily bussiness use , personal use or gaming experience."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,Product quality and delivery is great 👍
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,This laptop is very versatile go for it
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"After 7 days of usage:  The laptop is quite lightweight and well designed. Performance with i5 11th gen is incredibly fast. Battery backup is decent, 6-7 while browsing the internet and VLC media in the background. Display quality is amazingly good but I could see some colour shifting when watched from different angles (not an issue though). Also the brightness is good enough if you work in a well lit environment.  If you are not a fan of Lenovo laptops, go for this HP equivalent here amazon.in/gp/product/B08XBZBFCQ it sells cheaper at times and has the same specifications.  Consider purchasing this laptop for college, normal gaming, programming. Don't buy for full time gaming or professional grade video editing (But for youtube, its more than enough).  1.Performance is best & better for this price range. 2- 16GB RAM is the go to if you want future proof laptop. Trust me 8GB is not enough if you plan to keep 10+ chrome tabs open. 3. If you do high end gaming Fan makes noise and heats up badly. You can switch to the intelligent cooling mode but you have to compromise in performance. So if you want to game, keep a portable fan nearby so as to avoid throttling. 4.Nvidia GeForce MX450 will easily handle Mafia,Cyberpunk 2077,Grand Theft Auto V, Assassin's Creed Unity and many more . 5. Coming to SSD 512GB is M.2 Model. and there is not extra slot for upgrades. 6. It comes with Windows 10 no need to install windows while booting, it's pre-installed. 7. It also provides Microsoft Office Student 2019, only 1 year."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"I purchased this laptop from lenovo official website and got the defected one. I also saw the reviews there after two weeks that other person is also facing the same issue like me. Wifi is disconnecting automatically. From the time of creating the outlook mail in the new laptop i was facing the issue. I thought that only i got that defected one but in the lenovo official site the other person said that he was facing from the day 7 of his purchase(same wi-fi disconnecting problem). Now i am in the process of refund which is taking more than a month. Don't get attracted by more specs with less price. I did the same and regretting it. Its better to spend upto 1k extra for good built quality than spending many thousands in the future. Also the battery lasts upto 4 to 5 hours for normal usage and for gaming it is even less, I thought battery issue was also there for my laptop but engineer clarified that there's no issue with the battery. Hence those are the stats of the battery. Upto 8 hours ideally, but who wants that ideally see the practical numbers."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG0148IN,laptop,"Great laptop , worth it , great 👍 battery life, good performance, slim n light weight. Best for office work and light gaming . Only drawback is that it does has Ethernet port, but it has wifi 6 support 👍, overall value for money 💰"
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,It was said by the manufacturer that there is a backlit keyboard but there is no backlit keyboard available in this laptop...
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"Cons:- For me the performance is slow. My 4 years old redmi mobile is giving faster results than this pc, in opening apps and browsing. ( this is my first laptop, so might be all laptops are slower than android phones ? Idk).  I also faced some lagging issues (sometimes) while closing the app, it won't close unless you tap 3-4 times or you have to use other means to close it ( like- pad gesture to minimise and close it From task bar)  I also have to re-start it so that it can work smoothly.  Efficiency of laptop will decrease if you're using live wallpaper.(can't even handle a live wallpaper 🙄)  Camera is the worst part in this laptop.  Pros:- Looks premium Display is good All functions/apps/programs are working. HP branding ( Bas yahi hai )  Overall:-  After spending 45k in this laptop it's not giving me the satisfaction of having it.  In my opinion you should go for HP 14s-fq1030AU IF IT'S AROUND 50K  Comparison:- HP 14s-fq1030AU / HP 15s-gr0500AU Price 51k / 45k ( in sell with cards and all) Ryzen 5 5th gen / here 3rd gen 6 cores / here 4. Cache 8 / here 6. Clock speed 4.1 GHz / here 3.7 GHz Ram frequency 3200 MHz / here 2400 MHz. Weight 1.46 kg / here 1.74 kg Backlit / here no backlit 9 hr battery / here 5 hrs (acc. to company)  Remaining features are same except desplay 14 inch / here 15.6 inch"
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Please don't buy Hp products specially from Amazon ...very bad experience...may b they r selling duplicate products...n Hp customer service will keep on doing troubleshooting till Ur warranty expires
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"I bought this thinking the display would be no glare at all. But there is glare. There is lot difference between anti-glare and matte display. And AMD is not better than intel. I feel it is slower than intel. I don’t appreciate my choice. When you close the laptop and walk holding it, it opens a bit and makes sound. Could have gone to actual store and checked before buying it."
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"Laptop is really good. A excellent thing is Windows and office comes with life time validity which is really makes worth for buying. I been using it for a month no issues. No lag on opening multiple windows. Good for home uses like watching movies, emails, listening music, intermediate video and photo editing and basic games."
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Pros: 1. Reasonably fast 2. Thin and light. 3. Free windows work fine Cons: 1. Could have backlit keyboard. 2. Gets heated sometimes.
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"Screen is whitish in background and also dull in contrast. Contacted HP tech support, they try to solve remotely. Screen issue could not solve. So, I have to return it back as per Amazon's return policy. I had liked the RYZEN 5 processor with 512 SSD made the laptop classic, as it boots within 3 seconds and works fast. Only I faced the issue with display and keyboard. Other than this laptop is too good."
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"Its heavier laptop with good quality screen Keyboard is not very smooth but manageable for faster typing its not perfect but with Bluetooth keyboard it does the job well, less pendrive slots, not for businesses but good for personal usage"
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,This laptop is awesome in speed and looks both.. Ryzen 5 is better than i5 and Sdd in it make it more Faster. I love it..
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Peppy performance and a good amount of fast storage space. Wish it had a back lit keyboard but am satisfied with performance of the Ryzen 5 processor. Would recommend to anyone who wants a laptop for home use.
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Best
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Good
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Unable to boot within 4 days of buying. Unable to get refund/return yet from Amazon
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Touchpad is hard to use.
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Perfect screen quality.
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,Wonderful
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"8GB and SSD Combo makes the laptop very good for daily home usage. Would recommend to anyone who just wants to browse or attend online programs. Even for programming and WFH  The price is a bit high at 47k but you couldn't get anything better in this hard times. Also there isn't any bank offer now, but if you can get this during sale its a great deal.  #WHO CAN USE IT: Programmers for visual studio stuff and aws, Word, excel, movies, low end gaming like gta vice city etc. Online classes and zoom meetings. All these things will just work flawlessly and you can even multi task to a great extent. But if you want much better performance and i5 CPU get this HP laptop here amazon.in/gp/product/B08XNYN5QV . Its overall a better device.  #Things I like: - Lightweight design. Looks thin - FHD (1920 x 1080), micro-edge, anti-glare, 220 nits, 45% NTSC - 8 GB DDR4 RAM -Ryzen 5 3500U is comparable to i5 10th GEN -Gaming is acceptable, consider it doesn't have a graphics card. You can play GTA V is low to mid graphics smoothly. - SSD 512GB, which is a must - Windows 10 with MS Office Pre installed - Performance is good, boots in 5-10 sec, shutdowns in 3-5 sec - Average battery backup for moderate users (4-5hours)  #Things to note: - No backlight keyboard - Sound could be better - Built quality is not metal, it's plastic - 720p web cam not up to the mark - No fingerprint sensor for unlocking  I hope it helps. -Aj"
HP-Laptop-Windows-Natural-15s-gr0500AU,laptop,"The HP laptop life is short (end of support life) and you will not get support on any spare part so only option is to dispose the laptop or give away free. My screen was flickering and I asked to replace part but as it was end of life, no part is available (this is response from HP Support)"
ASUS-VivoBook-14-0-inch-i5-1035G1-X415JF-EB522TS,laptop,"I have purchased the laptop yesterday in an exchange scheme. Everything went smoothly, from exchange checks to delivery. I haven't yet started the use yet as I have asked for the expert to setup and install all the required softwares. But so far the screen quality looked perfect and battery life could have been better. I won't suggest it for gaming as it is Light weight product, which I guess won't support heavy usage. I would suggest, Asus ROG or TUF series for Gaming."
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,Please improve Battery Life
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,"Performance is osm, but it has a big battery problem Maximum battery life is 2 - 3 hours bcoz of battery is only 3cell and hp claims 7 hours🤣 But I'll highly recommend you to buy this its osm osm osm very osm performance I love it"
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,It's very good for daily business or personal work. I have been using this from last few days.
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,"I was looking for good laptop and I went through lot of models. I finally decided to for HP as the specs at the price compared to others was really good. Here is review based on short use :  - Looks premium and has good build quality - Screen is bright and has good resolution - Boot up time is super fast with less than 15 seconds - Fingerprint recognition is good. - Performance is really good. No lags or crashes so far. - Not checked for gaming as I have PS4 for gaming  I would like highlight HP support assistant, which has all the required updates and utilities including warranty details. Generally, such inbuilt tools are bloatware and I try to remove it as much as possible. But this one is very useful as it helped solve battery life problem and get other important updates like bluetooth driver update.  Battery life : Before BIOS update, the battery life was bad as described in other reviews. But after BIOS update from HP support assistant, the battery life has improved very significantly."
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,"Hey, this is very good laptop at this price segment. i am full satisfied with this laptop. i am using ADOBE PREMIRE PRO and ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CC software very well. and Those people who are saying battery draining problem. here is my recommendation is please UNINSTALL McAfee Antivirus and McAfee all program from your laptop and you can also remove unuse program. Because McAfee Antivirus running in background and auto scanning the files that's by battery is draining too fast. this method i used my own laptop and now my battery backup is normal 3-4 hours."
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,"Writing this review after 1 week of usage.  First things first, the delivery by Amazon was timely and the packaging was good. Be carefull with the seller though, I've found Appario to be quite dependable when it comes to electronics.  Now let's talk about the laptop - Pros: - very less startup time (less than 10 secs) - doesn't get heat up easily (may vary depending upon the usage and external conditions) - anti glare display - finger print reader is very responsive (should not be compared with phones) - performance is good enough (multi-tasking & gaming is possible without a glitch) - design is sturdy and premium looking (but since I've experienced an issue with my previous laptop regarding hinges, I feel like the same issue may happen with this one in the future too, there seems to be quite a lot of pressure building up on the hinges while opening the laptop. HP should look into it)  Cons - battery life (as it has been mentioned in all the reviews, yes it's only of around 2.5 hrs) (HP claims it to be 7-8 hrs which is not true, but if such is the case with other laptops too, then it shouldn't be an issue) - display has been acting up a bit (not that it hampers the performance, but sometimes after minimizing a window, the background looses pixels and a partial image appears. This happens only with BG and not the window you're working on and it gets fixed once you restart the device) (this issue has popped up 2-3 times already)  To sum it up, keeping aside the battery life and some minor display issues, I would definitely recommend this laptop for its performance and overall usage experience."
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,It should have 500 GB HDD. Rest is ok. I have already activated office and student 2019 with the help og HP customer support.

HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,The windows keeps crashing and restarting. I have made several call to hp support and done all the trouble shooting what they asked me but still the problem is not resolved. They refuse to send a technician and expect me to reinstall the windows by myself. I am not a computer tech to be able to do so. pathetic customer service. If Amazon can help in getting the issue resolved I would be thanlful.

HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,Good product but battery need to improve a lot. Though hp is claiming it will lust for 6-7 hours but actually it's totally drained out after 2.5 to 3 hours max. In same range Asus tuf series is offering better graphics card. So hp can look into that too.
HP-Processor-15-6-inch-Graphics-15s-dr3500TX,laptop,The SSD of 500 GB is on the lower side in the current times. Should have been at least 1 TB at the same price.

Edit: After 2 months of using, the laptop and the charger started to show heating problems. The laptop and charger both heat upto 50 degree celcius. And the mic stops working in between. Literally contacted the customer care 15 times and each time they talking for 30 mins to 1 hour and they would again and again run their stupid diagnostic tests. And when asked for a technician so that the problem can be checked, they said no. Regret buying this piece of junk. You can use it for warming your food."

Please be careful when you buy this Dell product. With a higher speed broadband connection, your laptop will not be able to capitalize on this speed.

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Best in class. Performance, Display, Battery backup are above excellent. A must have for every tech geek Bought this after selling my Yamaha R15, but no regrets.... It's speed is better than R15. 😅"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Pros:- 1. It's Superfast. It will feel fast on everything - from bootup, to app opening, to builds etc. 2. It's slim. Air has no fan hence it's form factor is even slimmer than Pro. 3. It remains cold even during heavy code builds. It's hard to find things which makes it warm actually. 4. I have tried several graphics heavy games and they run great without any heat as well 5. If you are just browsing with Wifi on, typically it loses 10% battery in 7-8 hours. But it's for Safari browser. It has achieved I guess what people will call power-efficiency nirvana. 6. Screen, Sound and Mic quality are awesome  Cons:- 1. Since it's winters in India now, some people might not like that it doesn't heat up the surroundings 2. For longer workloads - like if you are doing daily large video compressions/conversions and that takes like 15-20 mins, then this machine will not work as fast as Pro; as that's not the load it's optimised for. But ask yourself - whether you are gonna do that at all. 3. Camera is 720p and that sucks about every other laptop as well. But Apple has brought some software optimisations which will make it look better 4. It doesn't make sound of fan, so you might feel asleep if you are used that to keep track of your ML jobs.  Apple started a revolution with this. Go for it, it's worth it."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"If we could get it for around 70-75k with some kind of discount that would b huge.. anyways, super excited."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Excellent product very fast and amazing fast m1 chip so fast and faster than the intel processor what a power
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Should i buy the 16gb ram from apple store? This was the question i had for a long time. After going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant. This is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage. Why i opted for 8gb ram? My use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. Use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. But then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. Then i do a little bit of coding too. I do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. I did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. But I should wait for more to get the actual picture. So, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. This laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. As its very much portable and light weight. The battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging 😊). I shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Amazing speed and works flawlessly. Does not get hot like previous intel model. M1 models are a game changer. Apple will rule processor universe in future and M1 is only an entry processor.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am using Macbook M1 - 512GB version for more than 20 days now. I never noticed any heat. I am able to install almost everything I need. HomeBrew, VLC Player, VSCode, Darktable, Docker Preview, Chrome, and many more. iTerm with ohmyzsh no issue at all. node, ruby, python, java(azul jdk), php, elixir, go, typescript, many more not installed deno as I have to download x-code full(11GB) will do in future not installed android studio not installed rust not installed whatever I didn't install. Spotify, Prime Music were installed for music"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I dislike the fact that we have to buy a separate converter for USB and Mouse.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Bought it from Amazon for exchange and Amazon pay benefits.  This is a significant update for me from 2015 MacBook Pro. This machine is faster than Intel counterparts because of the new M1 chip. Keyboards, display are of top notch (Apple standard). Battery is super, average 10 hours work consumed only 20%.  Though the webcam is average but happy with overall performance."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I will not renew my prime membership
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Worst experience ever , first of all they sold me a bad product with display issues and now they is no proper response to replace or refund the lap and I have been trying to do this from last one week . I have been calling Amazon customer care from past 5 days . Worst worst experience ever"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Don't buy from this seller , I received a defective piece and they are not willing to replace it either... The function key seems to be short circuited and the keyboard is misbehaving like hell... what's the point of carrying an external keyboard after spending so much for this ...It's like stealing our hard earned money !!!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Ordered the M1 Air on 5th August and got it delivered on the 7th. Then on 18th noticed a black/grey spot on the display... quick google search revealed this as a dead pixel and quite common with M1 Macs. So I called up Apple and they offered me two options, either a new replacement Mac or full refund since mine is still under 14 days. As soon as I revealed that I purchased from Amazon, the Apple sales team said sorry they can't help me since Amazon is not Apple authorised seller.  I'm never buying another Apple product from Amazon again. If you want the full Apple experience like seamless replacement, refund or after sales then you need to buy it from Apple or from any of its authorised sellers. I made a costly mistake hope others will not after reading this message."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"if you are a person who ever thought of buying a high performance laptop at a great bargain, this is it ! An Apple Mac with alien tech capable of competing with i9 processor at a price of that processor unit alone. Got it with a great discount and exchange price making my choice a bliss.  Speed - Amazing - 10/10 Finally a laptop which will say ""Bring it On""  Sound - Awesome - 10/10 watch a movie an experience apple magic. I felt that surround sound so many times.  Display - Kickass - 10/10 I was unsure to whether I will like this 13.3)  Ease of use - 10/10 Get ready to become addicted !  Handling - 10/10 Light as a feather. You will feel scared almost everytime you take it  Battery - Exceptional - 10/10 - Sure that you will miss its charger ! I got 17hrs and 15% battery left on one charge over two days.. Watched Netflix a lot, Worked like hell, Did lot of heavy lifting like code builds and all, Countless hours of web and what not ! Like I almost forgot where the charger was since I didn't charge it for two days straight."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Well this is my first mac book! It's been more than 2 weeks! So far I have no complaints. Laptop boots up within 10 secs, battery life lasts more than 3 days. I have been doing basic stuff like browsing, connecting my ssd to transfers and watching movies to videos. I am not sure if its worth the money though as its pretty expensive for the basic model which is 86900 inr. As we know already its a fan less model, it literally has zero noise, it's gets very little warm on the surface after and hour or two of usage. Will give an complete review post 2 months."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Awesome product well done Amazon for successful delivery...
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is the first time i encounter such problem in apple products as i am a big fan of apple products usually they are known for their product long life but macbook air with m1 chip is a big disaster. It is dead within 3 days. Amazon please do something! After spending such fat money i can't bear any tension running behind service center. And the apple service center in patna.. omg they lost the ability to hear from their customers long back. And once you contact apple then they will tell you that apple is not responsible for the products sold by any third party website. The max they can do is to repair the system i mean really man? You buy new system and then give it to the service center for 3-4 weeks.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Hi, I have been an apple user- still have an old 2011 model. Then i switched back to dell for around 4 years. It's all good and smooth with Dell. And very recently I thought let me buy myself an Air. I like that its super sleek and somehow grey color is one of my favourites. So no surprizes the laptop comes in a nice packaging, (thanks to amazon for there on time and easy delivery). The only con of apple air is that its pricey but yes (if you are like me-you will realise its soon that in a long run, how this becomes such an important part of your life, its much more cheaper in value)  Super Pro's 1. M1 processors are highly efficient in processing. Also thanks to SSD 2. Battery life is crazy- last for 15-16 hours easily 3. Look and Design (there's not much to say- its very obvious)- Super classy, sleek and very light weight.  Con's 1. No cons  It's the best version of any Macbooks till date. To be honest, I do multiple things- I design, I edit videos, I code, and I browse. Everything is good. I wish I could have ordered a bigger storage one though which was a bit expensive for me. So I treated myself with a very handy Seagate SSD 500 GB and I use it on the fly. Something extra to carry but I still LOVE it.  Also, to let you know that- this is one of my first review that's written so throughly. So understand the excitement and satisfaction level of this product.  WISH YOU LUCK! Now go and Buy. :)"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Item is missing
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Charger heating issues and you will earthing issues in laptop. We need to buy separate adapter charger to overcome earthing.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Awful. Damaged product. Not value for money.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,The M1 based MacBook Air is simply the best laptop you can buy right now. With the MacBook Pro also using the M1 it's the first time in years that the Air's specs are almost identical to the Pro's at a much lower price point. For those worried most common applications like Chrome are already available native for M1. Other non native apps also work flawlessly.  Pros: 1. Noiseless 2. High screen clarity 3. Battery life of 3-5 days on average use 4. Very light 5. Fingerprint sensor 6. Keyboard is so nice you feel like typing more  Cons: 1. Not a big fan of true tone but you can always turn it off
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I got a diffective product with body bas problems. The laptop does not even sits properly on a surface, it's one side down, so frustrating. Honest suggestions to everyone, at least do not buy apple products from Amazon India, they just are selling diffective products - body defects, used products and even with system glitches. The best place to buy genuine and new apple products is at Apple India website."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Great battery life, beautiful design and amazing performance."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Having used Dell/HP laptops only this was the first Mac experience. Below are the observations: 1. Buying from Amazon - Got 5900 off on MRP plus another 6000 through credit card plus same day delivery. Checked the serial number online and its a genuine product. Thanks Amazon. 2. User experience - Switches on instantly, very light weight, screen is quad HD and you just cannot take your eyes of this machine. Compared to Windows the Mac experience is very smooth. 3. Must say the previous HP laptops I bought had issues with numeric keys not working or taking ages to load and frequent windows patches requiring restarts. With Mac there is no compromise on quality. 4. This has 2 ports only. The screen quality and trackpad are so good I ditched my plan to connect to external monitor Dell P2419H and logitech keyboard. Only use a M590 Logitech bluetooth mouse out of habit though one can do without it as well. In fact with this you dont need anything else on your table and can keep it clean. All I can say is having used this Mac its well worth the price and way better than all the Windows laptops in the market. Beware once you use this you would probably not want to touch a windows laptop again."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Lightning speed of M1. Beautiful rose gold. A breakthrough in technology.  Heating- yes it does get heated up. I am updating my review after a month. Rest all good
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It's very good in durability and best in class performance. For personal usage, it's the best affordable machine from Apple lineup of MacBooks."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Wonderful laptop.. Easy to carry and I love it.. Battery backup is awesome and crystal clear display. Worth the money.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Excellent machine! The battery life is better than your mobile phone 8hrs on heavy usage 12hrs on medium and more on just light usage. But you have to spend extra on USB type C Hub for more ports. This is a big draw back and you have to buy MS office separately. Just include it into your budget. Need not to go for 16GB RAM even for video editing or gaming. 8GB works great and there is no heating issue at all, save your bucks. Best among the lot. In today's date M1 processor is the best as per the performance and wattage consumption. I will recommend it."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Skipping the technical part since I'm sure most know about the M1 chip already. As a first time Mac user, I would say, switching to Mac from Windows was a very good experience for me. I didn't face any major issues. All I can say is that for professional and non-gaming use, this device is a monster. 11 hours of battery life easily, with video calls and multiple tabs and apps, along with windows on parallels ON, the whole working day! I never felt that I lacked anything. Even when there were power cuts, you can easily tether your phone or even better if you have an Iphone, and still keep going as if the power is still ON.  From performance to battery life, design, everything is amazing. But do know that you'll need to keep an extra 10 thousand rupees spare to get accessories which are essential, such as cover, hubs etc. But overall a great buy as a minimum 5 year investment, and you can still expect some resale value. I was bit disappointed with the Amazon delivery executive though, he simple left the item with the watchman without taking the OTP and he then calls up for it. But apart from this, a great purchase!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I have been using for about two weeks and I am very happy with the performance this Laptop gives. There are only three things which I’m not comfortable with, 1. When you open the laptop, you will need both hands, one to hold down the base part of the laptop and another to hold the lid else you will lift the laptop instead of opening. 2. The caps lock key is bit tight to press, not like other keys. But it still works fine, I just have to press a little harder then I press other keys. I don’t think this is an issue with all the macbook. 3. The USB ports are to closed to each other. It gives me some problem when I wanted two USB device in a same time.  Other then these, I am very happy."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am writing this review after a month of purchase. The apple m1 chip makes everything so much better. A lot of people told me that MacBook Air m1 is very close to the pro. Now I see why. The battery life is shockingly too good for an apple device. I use the laptop for browsing, emails, watching content and MS office; all of this runs flawlessly on this machine. The design is beautiful. The photos don’t do justice to the actual gold colour. I brought gold because space grey wasn’t available even after a long wait but I’m glad that happened because this is a rose gold colour and it looks splendid. This machine is worth every penny even without discounts, but if you get it with some credit card discount or good exchange deal like I did, don’t wait at all."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The Macbook Air 2020 with M1 Chip is definitely a great laptop to buy for personal usage. Its a premium quality machine with great aesthetics and immensely powered by the M1 chip. However, I was a bit disheartened when I came to know that lots of applications have blocked the M1 chip and you cannot install them in this machine (like Instagram, Netflix etc). Overall it might look a costly one to buy, but if you are okay with MacOS then this is the best thing that comes in 93,000 INR. Dell XPS with similar configuration is costlier than this. Go check youtube reviews for this machine to know more in details. Its your hard-earned money so make sure you invest in the right stuff."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Apple has shown his great work in this MacBook with own chip hardware. Apple will change the performance benchmarks from this lineup. Look wise cannot be better than this. However it has sharp edges where paint will eroded first. Battery works with great efficiency in sync of M1 chip. All other things work fine as older generation.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Every aspect of the Apple MacBook M1-2020 laptop - Design, Functionality, Display, Keyboard, Fanless operation, Zero heat build-up, Ultra fast finger print recognition &Trackpad are simply superb. Compact yet powerful. Battery charge sustenance. Fast response of Big-Sur operating software etc and etc. A few negatives which are far outweighed by the advantages and superiority of the device are: Lack of adequate ports, Charger capacity could have been better & non expandable storage memory size should have been larger if not it should have been user expandable, last one touch screen capability. In a nut shell this laptop has got all it takes to set a new benchmark for the computer industry."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"As good as it gets. Beautiful design, screen. Great keyboard, great speakers. Wonderful build quality. With M1 chips, Apple has once again done what it always does - revolutsonarized the game."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Excellent ... Just go for it , if you love Apple products.. The ones who are shifting from Windows will have to spend some time in learning !"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I have received my MacBook Air with M1 chip on time. It was well packed to protect any physically damage during shipping. The product works as smooth as it was expected.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"This is my second macbook air and like my previous macbook air 2017 this one made me go ga ga as well. I am very impressed with the battery back up and processing power of this machine. I had to buy a connector for various ports which is a pain as this version has only 3 ports. 2 USB-C on one side and a 3.5 mm audio jack on the other side. The display is awesome and clear. This version is a little heavier than 2017 Macbook air though. 256 GB sdd space was enough for me as I have external sdd and hdd where I store most of my data. The charger is different from the earlier Macbook Air 2017. Firstly there is no separate extension cable as was with 2017 Air. The charger is a USB -C charger and after connecting the charger only one USB -C port remains free for use which makes a connector must. The connector that I purchased had 2 male USB C ports on one side to connect and 2 USB - C female, 2 USB - A female, MMC Card female and HDMI female port on other ends. The Air comes with MacOS Big Sur pre installed."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The speed with which native apps open is amazing, the battery life is fantastic.  You will need to spend more money on the right connectors etc, especially if you want a desktop setup. My Thunderbolt 2 monitor has a lot of USB-A ports to connect my mouse and keyboard and all I had to get was the (rather expensive) Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 connector for Rs 4,500 (which I paid for with my Amazon Card cashback). There are no third-party options. Made more sense (given my needs) than spending Rs 6,000+ on a flimsy USB-C hub or Rs 12,000 on a USB-C dock like the Dell D6000. Thunderbolt docks in India are overpriced and unnecessary if you don't need the speed."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Fabulous performance
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"A powerful machine..! What else can you expect from a MacBook. The A1 chip performance is out of the world, I hope it retains the same. Luckily I got this delivered on time, I have heard these A1 Chips are genrally Out Of Stock most of the time."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Became dead after one week of proper functioning. Need to be taken to customer care and they took more than 20dayz to fix the issue. Such a horrible exp even after emptying the pocket.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Great Product 🔥🔥🔥 M1 is really good.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Do I have to write about it? Perhaps not. No one can get disappointment with this device. It is simply THE BEST.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,The MacBook while being all that is advertised to be is imbalanced when kept on a flat surface. This is not a nice feel for a premium device like MacBook.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"This laptop I've got it for 75k with HDFC offers, which is the best deal. Also, battery backup is simply amazing and with rest of the device am sure all by now know it has an awesome screen. However the only expectation is apple to quickly load apps customized to M1 into their store or atleast most used ones. Overall build quality is 10/10, screen 10/10, performance 10/10, support 9/10, battery 10/10, sound quality 8/10, value for money 9/10."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Pros: - Battery Life - No other laptop with this form factor comes near to this one. - Performance - With the M1 Chip processor from Apple, Software and Hardware work together like magic. - No Fan for cooling the processor, so super silent. - Compact and lightweight. - Mac OS  Cons: - Normal limitations related to Mac OS (For example, gaming).  Recommendation: The best Apple laptop period. Go for it if you are not a gamer or dependent on software exclusive to windows."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Small and compact design. The speakers are great, with excellent bass and surround. The display is incredible, thanks to the retina by Apple. Battery backup is awesome on the new M1 chip. 2~3 drop during the cold nights. Overall it's a must-buy for someone looking for a compact, powerful, efficient, and gorgeous display, with huge speakers."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  IT IS BETTTEREST PRODUCT THAN OTHER LEADING BRANDS.MI CHIP PROCESSOR’S WORK IS TOO AWESOME.EVERYTHING LIKE DESIGN WEIGHT DIFFERENT PARTS SCREEN ETC IS APPRICIABLE.I WANT TO GIVE MORE THAN TEN POINTS VALUE FOR MONEY 👌😀❤️🌈💃🏿
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Pro 1.Battery : more than 15hr in day to day software development use. 2. Exilent performance 3. Best build quality 4. Instant open 5. Most secure 6. Trackpad you will love it  cons: 1. M1 chip not support all the software.( It will improve with time). 2. Keyboard ( It sucks. specially if you are typing for long time. No key travel) 3. Ram (Go for for 16gb I have done this mistake. It will help you on longer run) 4. If you are planning to do longer work like ( Video editing, Machine Learning or Deep learning) It will heat a lot ( Go for pro version ) 5. you have to buy office :)"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,In a span of 3 months....my laptop is dead.  Hope apple service is good
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"This is my first MacBook. I am not a video editor or software professional. So can speak about the design and overall performance only. It’s good enough for my daily office works and browsing. Only thing I required was office tools like excel, word and PowerPoint, that was not there but I purchased office 365 and managed it. I think response time is pretty more comparing to my previous HP intel i5 10th gen. but overall it’s good looking and very handy. Battery life is excellent no words to say, similarly video clarity and sound is also awesome. Apple was dream for me and now I owned it."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Very good product Battery - For online classes for 8 hours each day, works 2 days! without charge Weight - Extremely light weight! Easy to carry Camera - Camera quality is excellent Keyboard - Backlight is there and smooth button with sensor Touchpad - very smooth Screen - Clear Everything is good!! Thanks for this product"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Apple delivers great product as usual. Super battrey life, responsive touch button. Only problem, these products are too expensive and no USB ports. Suoer fast delivery by Amazon."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am not a programmer or a graphic designer but I needed this for coursework and statistical analysis. The battery seems to be everlasting and I charge it once in 2 days and even that is super fast. The weight is light and the ergonomics is great. The MacBook interface is just great and you won’t regret this purchase. It took me a day to get used to it, being a previous Windows user but everyday I discover new hidden features and it’s great. Don’t buy it to show off but buy it for the absolute workhorse that it is."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Overall very good but it's started heating now.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Amazing product from apple - long battery life, lasts upto 8-9 hours easily. Never had encountered any hangs or frozen screens or apps. Overall experience has been outstanding.. must buy for all apple enthusiasts (like myself 😉)"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The best laptop I have ever used! I switched from windows to apple for the very first time. And it was worth it. This piece begs you to keep working! The most significant plus point is definitely battery life. I charged it on one Saturday night and with daily usage of nearly 1-2 hours of YouTube and coding, till next Sunday it was at 19%. Just mind-blowing! Display is awesome, sound is awesome too! Definitely worth it"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,All though it is value for money.It`s way too high for indian standards. The previous version of Macbook is 68000 this is 93000 the price should have been 78000 to 80000.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I was skeptical about the screen 13.3 inch 16:10 size but got used to it quickly. The battery do really lasts more than I expected. Its built very solid. The screen is phenomenal colorful good for photo editing ,sharp, black text looks bit grey. M1 processor makes this laptop sorry macbook very fast . I would recommend to buy it. Through discounts and exchange offer i got base version at 77k."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It takes a lot to get a ""Best God-damn laptop"" from GeekyRanjit. And this MAc with M1 is the best i have ever used! lightening fast and consistent every single time. been 5 months now and works like a charm without any hiccups."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Apple is way better than microsoft in every sense. The laptop if fast ,sleek and extremely efficient . Dont think twice. It improved my productivity two folds and made working fun.."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Only problem is many app are not supported and virtual features is also not supported so window installation is not possible
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Good upgrade from MacBook Pro 2012 to MacBook Air M1 chip .. still using MacBook Pro after upgrading ram and using SSD 😅
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Great product ! Battery life is fabulous. Performance for optimised apps is great.  Make sure to check for the apps which you use are optimised for M1 otherwise it might be a tussle.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Macbook air provides good value compared to other laptops in this range (still expensive). But I received faulty Capslock key, will get it changed asap. Overall happy with the purchase. Will consider Thinkpad series for next buy. Do check them out as well"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Cons: 1. Logo doesn't glow as expected. 2. There is no extra 8gb GPU. This is just a false statement used for marketing.  Pros: 1. Got the expected colour, space grey 2. Excellent battery life 3. Speaker Sound quality amazing 4. Fast processor."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Almost everything that you could ask for. Just look out for software/applications which have not yet been ported to M1 chip. Especially if you're planning to run virtualization, data science/ML ecosystem, you might hit some blocks."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Fast and silent. Far exceeds performance of i7 of comparable windows laptops and obliterate battery life stats. Highly recommended.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Battery life is very good. This is very light weight. Quite fast. Does not get heated.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"My first Mac, so far had no issues, in 15 days hanged once for 15 secs during shutdown, else everything is good. Absolutely no noise and no heating. Battery backup average 9-10 hours for moderate usage (browsing, movie, youtube, streaming etc). If pocket permits then you can have this blindly without even attempt to comparing with other PC."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"No complaints, looks more compact than 2017 model."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Smooth laptop which runs without any hickup and best part is the transition between apps or browsers which runs seamlessly.. and as claimed by the apple the batter runs min of 10hours on a single charge. But only cons is its nt dat light weight as I was expecting it to be.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Without a doubt one of the most powerful devices out there.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,This laptop is extremely fast and has a long battery life. Been using it for normal daily use since last 6 months and it never hanged even once. Also the speakers are great! I love this laptop
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Display is ultra-shiny & reflective, causes eyestrain. Onscreen print is not black but grey - & can't be changed - even harder to see. Fast and lots of features but I'm sorry I bought this machine, it's not User Friendly, my old Mac was much nicer to use."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Great laptop with great battery and obviously M1 chip is best
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It is best device you can ever ask for, the sluggish behaviour of windows laptops is totally overwhelming by its speed and performance"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,This is my first ever apple product. I can say it is really fast. I bought this for my personal use as well as software related task too.  You should go for it or wait for next version to be released this year.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Love it. Would have been happy all the useful software like office etc. were bundled with the Mac. One need to purchase , a hassle."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Just buy it , altogether on different level . its a beast ."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,The best laptop as of date.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It is probably 20 k more expensive with exchange and discounts as compared to US, but I did check the prices at store too it's almost the same range"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Packing and delivery was good. I had exchanged it with MacBook Pro Mid 2012 model and compared to that model, this MacBook air is super light weight. This is the review based on just opening the package. So more can be made out of this laptop after a month or so."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Incredible machine in terms of performance.The screen is unlikely another laptop out there crisp and vibrant.  Cons: Webcam
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The product is amazing as every product from the stables of Apple. Absolutely super speed booting and very responsive apps. However, for a person looking. For value for money, there are cheaper options with other OS."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Macbook suddenly stopped working after 2 weeks. It is not turning on.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I am using it for video editing and working awesome compare to any windows laptop so go for it
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I have received the product and it is awesome. Exchanged my previous laptop(Lenovo) with the present Laptop (my new MacBook Air)😊
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Sturdy great built doesn't heat no noise good battery
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Been Using it for 2 weeks now and there is nothing bad I can say about it. Coming from a low end laptop, this laptop blows me away everytime. It's amazing. The Battery Life is so goood. Works for 10 hours straight in a day."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,There are a number of feature reviews available on public forums... we may guided by them. I am a happy user.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Superb. Speed is amazing as it's provided my apple m1 chip based on 5nm technology and battery backup is approx 18 hrs. Looks of apple Mac book air m1 is very nice. Overall one of the perfect device.

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Freakin' awesome !!
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,THE best laptop in market for office use and video consumption. Battery life is amazing. Easily it would last more than 6 years.

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Battery life is awesome.. feels so premium!! Got a great deal on Amazon! Nevert thought I would buy a apple laptop online!
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Just wow. But battery life seems to be lower than projected in adds.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It's a magical product from Apple. Battery life 💯 Not that light, but definitely lighter than other products in the market."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Perfect
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,This is pure elegance

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"bought macbook air m1 for 93k, sold my old car for it but worth it, now i have to walk 5 km to go to my working place daily, still worth not to spending 100 rs per litre petrol on my car"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"M1 has the fastest CPU have ever made.The longest battery life ever in a MacBook Air. And a silent, fanless design. Super excited 😁🙌"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Although my purchase doesn't show it as verified, I have bought the MacBook Air on Amazon.  I have transitioned from windows to Apple MacBook knowing that it's the first time that an apple device is actually value for money . This MacBook simply put just feels like a high end mobile phone. It's so smooth, buttery animations, excellent trackpad, excellent battery life and performance.  Things that impressed me instantly: 1. Display 2. Speakers 3. Trackpad 4. Build Quality (Dense and strong) 5. Battery life 6. Performance 7. Safari 8. Wifi 6  Yes, I was confused for a day but got used to whole macos and as a windows user once you get used to the macOS, you will start appreciating the laptop even more. OS wise, I would still like windows for office work. Air would be the best personal laptop where I am doing a lot of browsing and some coding for personal use. I dislike the folder structure and files part on Mac OS, so it's a no go for me for professional use unless I am forced to use it in the office.  Issues: 1. Absolutely nothing  This is not a specs game but what Apple is offering for 90k is much much more than the comparable laptops on the windows side. You cannot beat the build quality and smoothness on Mac.  I am very impressed and hopefully the previous versions are nothing like this or else I would be disappointed that I didn't get this machine earlier  Update after 1 month of usage: 1.) Facing download issues in app store sometimes where the download speed is too slow. I think this is mac os 11.2.3 issue  2.) Display is 2.7k and is crisp for a laptop. Speakers sound great. I have tried my headphones and BT earphones, both seem to have enhanced sound quality while using on a Mac. Maybe they have put a quality DAC.  3.) Can't install windows through bootcamp, can do with parallels but parallels is expensive.  4.) The default office apps are of no use (pages, numbers etc). I am currently using libre office but office 365 would be great. If you buy windows laptop of similar price, most probably you will get office suite for free  5.) Some apps don't work well, they keep crashing (ex: Spotify, Twitter).  6.) For basic use, I think nobody needs a macbook air, because there is good amount of downside if you are transitioning from windows. If you are into video editing or coding, I would highly recommend this product.  7.) iPhone and iPad apps suck. Don't even need to download.  8.) You can't play games because of Apple's decision . Apple arcade and apple tv+ have disappointing games and tv shows. Not worth paying a penny  Verdict: I feel the app transition from intel based to arm architecture is still incomplete and has a lot of scope for improvement. If these base laptops are going to be the cheapest in the line till next year, I would recommend you to buy else look for later editions which are rumoured to come with mini led display and more ports with more processing power."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I've bought the new MacBook Air M1 about 20 days ago and I have noticed a creaking noise every time I shut the lid down after having it open for a good amount of time. This noise isn't there when I open it and close it immediately though. It only happens when I close the lid after a while. I don't know if this is normal or if I should take it to a service person. I'm also wondering if it would be covered under warranty if there was any problem with the hinge. (It's a new laptop and I have not dropped it or damaged it in any way).
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Excellent machine 👌🏻💻. Only ram is of DDR3 type. But it's processor amazing. Best built quality and largest battery in any MacBook ever.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I got this to replace my 7 years old Windows laptop and the difference is massive. This thing sprints past anything you throw at it. I primarily use it for my office work added to the Photoshop and Premier Pro edits in bits and pieces. It is unbelievably capable and efficient for a laptop that does not even have a fan to stop it from thermal throttling. I am listing down some of the pros and cons that I had found on using it for my daily tasks.  Pros: 1. Superfast M1 Chip. Nothing in the market at this price compares to what it does. 2. Display: It is gorgeous. Windows laptops at this price give you a 1080p at max and this is 2560x1600. True Tone adds fire to it. 3. Apple ecosystem: If you have an iPad or an iPhone, using devices together is effortless. 4. Battery Life: It is insane. I am getting 12+ hours of SOT regularly with mixed usage. Having to charge a laptop once in 2 days increases its practicality exponentially. 5. Design: It is flawless, sleek and lightweight. 6. Trackpad: You dont see people talking about this part of MacBooks quite often but I think we should. It is amazing, the taptic feedback, the precision and the gestures are so good that you will never feel like going back to a physical mouse.  Cons: 1. Ports: The biggest issue for me is the lack of ports on this MacBook having only 2 USB-C and a 3.5mm audio jack, you sure need to buy an adapter right away to use almost everything with it. 2. Camera: The 720p camera in 2021 sucks. It is not acceptable even with the optimisations Apple brought in with Big Sur. 3. The price: The base model is only 256 GB and additional RAM or SSD costs a fortune.  At last, I think if your usage is medium to heavy load on a regular basis, you should rather go for the Pro which has a fan to reduce the chances of thermal throttling causing a drop in performance. For everyone else, this laptop is more than you need."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"It's the best laptop for students as well as adults.I would recommend if you are a university student buy the macbook from apple store for education(online) where you will get this at a price of 83,000 only,that's almost 9to 10000 off!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"M1 Processor from Apple makes it super fast to do multitasking, complex excel sheets, Zoom or Microsoft Teams with Video & execute programs.  Super light, no heating and great battery life. Awesome looks.  Inbuilt apps like FaceTime, Keynote, Notes, Email, iMovie and Siri are perfect.  Safari is the best browser. And you don't need anti-virus software as Apple OS includes built-in security."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Display issue... Worst laptop... Returned...
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Doesn't get warm at all, even while charging and using simultaneously. I will review heating again during summer months. My printer doesn't work with this mac. Thinking of getting an airprint enabled printer. TYPE C MULTIPORT HUBS WILL CAUSE INTERFERENCE WITH WIFI, ONLY BUY APPLE BRANDED HUB. I have an aukey hub which I bought from Apple store, and it causes wifi interference when using one of its usb 3.0 type a port, other ports don't cause problems. Coming from a windows laptop, this laptop is amazing, especially battery life and performance. 8gb does get used up while using multiple apps, but you won't feel it because of swap memory used. Display is great, amoled would have been better."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Top notch. 2 day battery life for medium use. Performance is great. So good that it stays cool to the touch even after an hour of continual use. Apple quality: the CNC Aluminum body is just perfection, with no sharp edges. The palm rest is rigid, supportive, and out of range of the hot components, meaning, it’s cool to the touch. Always. Now, the reason only 4 stars awarded to this amazing machine. The absolute garbage external monitor experience. Trust me. It’s bad. Though the output resolution is the promised 4K at 60hz, the font is rubbish, and the apps and windows are badly pixelated.  Verdict: The best laptop to buy in 2020-21, if you aren’t planning on connecting it to an external display.  If you liked this content, check out braintrooper.info"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Excited to buy my new M1 Mac air, if we get any offer till Christmas or new year. Also it will be helpful if memory customization can be given by Amazon."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Alright, I have been a long time Windows User, and I must say that this laptop has been quite amazing. I mostly use this for minor video editing, using my cloud apps, working on my projects, coding and development, and for watching videos and browsing constantly. I had slightly dipped my toe in the Apple ecosystem back in 2020 when I had purchased an Ipad, which became my main computer for web browsing and reading books device. It also made me not use my main Windows computer even less as pretty much 60 percent of my workflow was transferred to my iPad. Now this MacBook has become my main device for basically every computing task I can think of. The typing experience has been stellar, quite simply the best keyboard on a laptop hands down! Also the built quality and the hinge design of this laptop made me feel safe to use this as frequently as I want and for as long as I want.  My experience with Windows was on a sharp decline from being quite usable to getting in the way of my productivity. The amount of maintenance that my Windows PC requires was mind boggling, especially towards the end of its life cycle. This laptop was preceded by a computer with an FX 6300 chip and 8 gigs of RAM. So naturally, this was just a massive improvement. This laptop has scored 3 times the score of my previous computer on GeekBench. I can feel that difference in general usability and I personally feel that by daily drivering this laptop I have become a part of a revolution in the computing space. The apps in this mac have never taken more than 5 seconds to boot. Doesnt matter if the app is x86 or an ARM based app, all of them are super optimised. Also almost every general app has a 64 bit version out now so you can have that app in your system regardless. Now I realise that most people who will be buying this laptop are going to be either artists or developers, but even if you are a general user who wants a decent computer to learn stuff on or to use it for spreadsheet or document work, then this laptop is value for money, provided you have the budget for it. However, you do pay the Apple Tax with this product much like you do with every other product that the company has released in the country. If you can get it from US or UK, it is worth getting from there as you will obviously save copious amounts of money and you can also redeem the 1 year of international warranty should the need arise."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Go for this MacBook Air without a thought! I saw SO many reviews last year before buying this. There were such weird complaints that this heats up etc. and that is not true! I was deciding between this and MacBook Pro but bought this as only this was available during lockdown. Great decision and as I don’t need more advanced features. If you are not a gamer or video editor, then this should be the laptop of choice for you. I shifted from a Dell to this so adjusting to Mac OS took some time but I love it now and yeah my only issue is it’s too thin for my comfort. I have put a hard case on both sides to protect it and make it heavier. The speed, graphics, space all are top notch and I’m glad I didn’t buy a higher model. Five stars!"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Everything is premium. But don’t but if you are sensitive to headaches and eye strain. Personally I’m sensitive to leds(pwm flickering) Else you will lose money and as well health. Just want to share me experience and awareness. Happy if at least one was helped. Also i didn’t like the fact there are no apps for Netflix and amazon prime even after more than 6 months of release.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I am a student and using this for quite a time it’s absolutely a great laptop a beast in itself. I can do all my tasks without any worry for battery and i have to charge it once a day (i am a heavy user with screen time approx 8 hrs a day) overall you should buy it. The M1 chip made it more powerful than ever. I was using macbook air 2017 earlier. I changed it in and don’t regret.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I bought this product about a week ago and I'm obsessed. This is insanely powerful. And I love the color, I bought it in silver and it's so beautiful. I bought it through Apple official website and used Education discount in which I got MacBook Air M1, Silver, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM for ₹83610. Loving this MacBook. The design and the keyboard is the best. Feels good to write on keyboard. It's been 2 weeks and I haven't charged it yet. The battery life is good. And the best part it is so thin and compatible I love apple's design. The size is the only con but otherwise it's a win win. Best for students."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Excellent product which has more power. Battery life and performance is great for me, I run 6-7 applications at a time (Full Stack Developer). Combination of 256Gb and 8Gb is enough for me. I'm using this machine since last 6 months, and it is working great (I've purchased from Apple Store, and got 18% GST benefits + 3000 Free accessories + 6000 HDFC CC discount). It was a great deal for me.  Cons for me: - Camera is just 720p, and it sucks after paying a good amount for this machine. - It has 13inch screen, so you need an additional pay for monitor. - Expensive accessories like Mouse, keyboard, USB Hub etc.. We need around 50,000 more to buy these."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Extremely light weight, great screen display, quick start, great battery life. Apple MacBook is the only laptop that you can keep in your lap for hours without being subjected to hot air. I consider that as biggest differentiator w.r.t windows laptops. Why anyone would want to spend 50-65K INR on a windows laptop (i5, SSD configuration) and suffer heating issues when Apple MacBook Air (M1 chip) is available for 85 K (considering HDFC card offers) ?"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Now I don't have to worry about installing drivers, getting genuine office package, antivirus, windows updates, etc. It's all sorted with Mac OS. Touch pad especially is really smooth.  Pros - Light weight Super slim Amazing display Never lagged for me even when I played 4k video on it along with other apps in background Battery is jumbo  Cons - Only usb C ports, so you have to get a usb converter to get the job done"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I purchased it from the online Apple Store with a student discount and got it in 83K and got free Airpods 2 worth 15K free.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Very good for student level.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"This is not the product which is expected from Apple, the apple executives say that the apple logo will glow but upon receiving its found that the apple Logo on back of screen do not glow. Now when i am trying to speak with them they are putting their hands up..... never expect such poor things from apple"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Okay so a few months ago I purchased the m1 macbook air base model and I can't believe how fast it is, when I compared it to the previous intel based macs this guy is leaps and bounds better than the Intel, if u have an Intel machine , it wouldn't even be possible for u to edit photos but m1 in this mac handles even the most heavy graphically intensive edits and games and more , if ur in a market for the best value for money and the best performance this is the laptop to get. And when it comes to the display, it comes with a little more than quad HD 2560×1600 resolution which comes with p3 color gamut for u display needs out there. The battery life u need not worry about its amazing , I get like 16 17 hrs of use on light use."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"The new M1 is superb! I was about to buy it from Amazon but then stumbled across Educational discount at Apple's official website. I'm a music teacher, and my school was not listed in their database, so I contact Apple and they just set up the discount offer manually for me, and I got it for a sweet 83k! That's a huge 9k+ discount!  Kind of makes sense if you're a parent or if you know someone who's a student / teacher / staff in any school, college or university."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Apple is always High value for money - its worth the buy and original product with perfect package. It was a gift and I loved the way it was delivered
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"This is a laptop having ram 8GB, non expandable. So you are stuck with slow laptop for your whole life. Buy a laptop where you can expand upto atleast 16GB ram."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,This laptop is a beast. Is my all rounder companion. Does its job. Battery backup is awesome. Can be used for gaming if you run Windows 10 in it using bootcamp. The processor is awesome. Overall nice experience. Will attach photo few days later.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Got this mac air @ ₹ 83,700 Its just amazing. I was using windows laptop earlier and decided to switch to mac and after using for 2 weeks i can say its great .. Each and every part of this laptop is just amazing, its display, its speaker, its keyboard, its trackpad, and ofcourse its build quality.... Every part is amazing."

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Transition from windows to mac. Smooth functioning. Still some apps yet to be compatible with M1 chip.  Extremely light weight. Battery performance - 16 hrs. Awesome.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,I Bought this Mac for My Exam preparations though its Not meant for it. I JUST wanted to go for Air M1 to explore its features and Wanted a lap which gives an average life of 5 years
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Amazingly fast processor. Go for it if you can pay hefty amount. Using it since 1 month, no issues at all."

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Apple is not considered for value for money, but this laptop has the most value for money I've ever got. This is a ~1L laptop but it performs better than 2.5-3L laptops. Getting this on a deal is something you won't repent in the next 5-6 years."
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"No fan, no sound. No heat at all. Instant wake when you open the lid. Excellent Audio Quality Keyboard well lit No LED display but it is really good. 8gb 256gb ram enough for most use case"

Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"I am having macbook air m1 2020 with 512gb harddrive. Its starting up with keys like spacebar,command,p,k,4,5... etc. Other than power button too. If anyone facing same issue lemme knw @cyrilrathore91gmail.com"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Awesome display and one of fastest processors along with an excellent battery backup make it worth buying!! Built quality and design are magnificent. An elegant one from Apple. Just in love with it.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,It's cracked and when i first time i turn on it coming lines on screen amazon worst coming in world
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Whatever you wanted from the laptop is right there. Performance is absolutely mind boggling. Solid build and easy to carry. Worth every penny you spent.
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Awesome experience, best macbook air ever made, m1 chip is very fast and powerful, battery life is also good, my 1st apple Product 😁"
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,Good product from Apple. Battery life is awesome Actually light weight as they claim. Must buy for those looking for class
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,THE KEYBOARD is all over the place. Each key states a certain function but performs something else. Very unhappy with the product
Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Using it from past 45 days daily for 9-10 hours ( even more ). Cons- 1. Some apps are not optimized and crashes a lot ( like chromium which I have to use daily ), so if you have to use some app because of your work please check first in forums or fb groups with other users. 2. You need to buy a cleaning kit ( microfibre cloth and screen cleaner ) otherwise you will see a lot of marks, spot on it. 3. Charger- Apple just hate chargers and charging speed charger included is 30W only and it gets really really hot while charging. Charging is very slow. 4. No upgrade option - you can't upgrade ram or storage after buying 5. Keyboard- feels fragile may be because of slim profile of laptop and only one type of light is there, which looks good but different colours lights won't hurt. 6. Press any key and it will turn on which is annoying sometimes. Now here comes the Pros- 1. Amazing battery 2. Amazing performance 3. Mac OS - much better than windows. Smoother, easier. I like mission control a lot. 4. Display- very bright and good quality 5. Speakers- really good and loud 6. Ports- 2 thunderbolt and 3.5mm jack, and honestly I need these only. So, a really good machine. Value for money. Not for people who like to play a lot of games. Otherwise the only laptop you need for everything. You can get better deal in Apple Authorised stores."
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-39-62,laptop,Gud product
Acer-Aspire-Intel-Generation-39-62,laptop,Very bad not upto the mark screen is flickering go for Dell and hp brand they are more trusted than this
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"This is got to be best ultrabook which is priced less than 60K, I bought this at Rs.58990/- from Appario Retail Private Ltd. Seller Its model name as per lenovo website is ideapad 5 14ARE05 Various features are not mentioned in product description page and I was doubtful when I ordered whether it will have certain features like fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, etc. Turns out it does have fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, MS OFFICE(home and student) lifetime validity. Comes with a feature where laptop automatically boots up when the lid is opened Boot up time is less than 13 seconds Keyboard panel area( palm rest area) of laptop has got a matte finish, does not feel slippery, feels good to hold. Getting Battery Backup of more than 6 hours, just doing regular tasks, no gaming. ( it has different modes such as Intelligent cooling, extreme performance, battery saving mode, I have kept it on intelligent cooling mode, you might get more backup if you are using battery saving mode) My device came with Premium Care Warranty Pack (i.e. It has a base warranty as well as accidental damage protection for 1 year)  Now there are some negatives: You cannot completely bend the display to 180 degrees ( like few others Lenovo laptops) Audio Quality is Average(no bass) Camera is below average(its actually worse than you expect it to be) You may feel the base of the laptop warm although CPU temperature didn't cross 50 degrees Celsius mark. But still there is a bit of warmth at the base when you are using on your lap.  Overall a very good purchase, you can go for it if you are looking for a 14-inch laptop in the 60000 price bracket. (excuse me for any typos)  EDIT : RAM is NOT upgradable (Laptop was listed recently on lenovo india website and RAM is onboard, contacted the support number to confirm and the representative has confirmed that there is NO second slot for RAM)"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Amazing spects under 60k but complete details must be mentioned like ssd type, Mhz of ram, graphics details, keyboard type, power adapter watt."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,If graphic processor detail mentioned that should be great as international version have vega 7 and india version detail is not mentioned
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Read the update at the end. My review:- Got it for ₹59k. It's a nice laptop with a hell of a processor, good display, fast read/write speeds, fast boot up, decent battery life, 65W fast charging, fast & accurate fingerprint sensor, backlit keyboard with 2 settings, lightweight, good for programming and stuff but it has its cons such as the Soldered RAM which is a huge bottleneck and it can be a deal breaker for some people. In the product specifications, it says that the Type C port supports Power Delivery, but it doesn't support that in reality. I tried to play GTA V but I could only play it on default settings @ 800*600 resolution and it worked very well as expected, although I couldn't increase the resolution to even 1280*720 due to the limited video memory. Although the speakers are front firing, it's not that loud, better to invest in some external speakers. Webcam, as expected is average/ below average.  Update: Within 6 months of purchase, the touchpad started to freeze randomly which I thought was a bug, but in reality, it wasn't. Also, after 3 more months i.e., within 9 months of purchase, the display frame started to come out by itself and broke the hinge. Since, I got the Premium Care Support with ADP (Accidental Damage Protection) free at the time of purchase, I was able to get those parts replaced. I don't have very high hopes that it will last for 5-6 years. So, if you use your laptop for just 1-2 years, then go for it, otherwise don't."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"I purchased it for Ryzen 7 4700U, but realised apart from that each and every component in the laptop is cheap quality. Camera is as good as absent. Mic is not working. No proper support from Lenovo staff. Buttons are cheap quality. Its track pad is flimsy and started wobbling in a week. Dont Buy cheap chinese product. Go for Dell or HP or something. I did not pay heed to negative reviews and suffering now. Dont make my mistake."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Worth Every Penny. This laptop is amazing. Display is alright, nothing special. Processor is 🔥🔥. Charges via type c but only with original lenovo type c 65w charger. Only thing limiting the laptop is 8gb ram.  Also the exchange didn't work because my old laptop was chipped very slightly. That is BS. It works fine just because it is old I wanted to exchange it.  Edit 1: The Laptop does support USB Type C Charging, you just need a compaitible Type C PD charger. I tried with my Samsung 25w pd charger which came with the M31s. I'll also upload a short video to show charging through both chargers. Also laptop DOES NOT charge with normal USB Type C chargers. I tried with both Warp Charge 30T ( Oneplus 7t pro) and SuperDart 65w ( Realme x50 pro) chargers."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,I can confirm that this one has got a vega 7 igpu
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Amazing laptop for this price tag. Because of the compact size. RAM is not upgradeable. Laptop is very light weight and boot up is really fast. They have mentioned ssd memory as 512 gb but shows 477 gb in properties. The charger is very compact. 16 gb ram would have been perfect companion .
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Good laptop. Sound is relatively bad. I have problem with charger heating.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Build quality is not good, keyboard and touchpad quality is very cheap. Fast processor overall good laptop in this price."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Best laptop under 60000. Ram is upgradable to 12 GB. 2 slots are used with 4 gb ram each of 3200 meha hertz and only the 1st slot is soldered to the motherboard. One can change the 2nd ram to 8 GB but you won't be needing that as 8GB ram with 4700U Ryzen 7 is enough for running blender and daz studio for animation and rendering together. Magic happens due to the 512GB NVME SSD and extremely slim form factor with no sound and trackpad is like a macbook one. Power button includes a fingerprint sensor and the power brick is a one wire setup which is better than those two wire setups. Fast charge with amazing battery life.  One thing, do not change the 2nd ram to 8 GB as the compatibility of 2 4GB ram is better than a 4GB and a 8 GB ram.  Never go for an i7 10th gen laptop as it fails drastically in comparison to this. Check the video of Geeky Ranjit on YouTube (comparison of i7 10th gen with ryzen 7 4700u).  Everyone says that intel has better performance in single core but after seeing the results ryzen 7bis better in single core performance than i7 and also multi core performance is always better than intel."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"So my usage is basically for work, i.e. emails, presentations, zoom calls, office programs, and casual internet surfing with some video consumption. This device does all of this with no load, neither on the fan nor on the ram. The boot up and shutdown is blazing fast at 3-4 and 2 seconds respectively. It charges 70-80% while working in 50-60 mins with fast charging mode on. Screen seems decent to me as I ain't no professional colour corrector and I can hardly notice any difference or negatives . The brightness is apt for indoor use but could have been better for outdoor use however it's anti glare will help you in outdoors. Build quality is good, top is of metal and rest everything is of plastic but it feels sturdy and premium. However it's a finger magnet for those with sweaty hands. Track pad and finger print scanner are amazing in this price range, they are very responsive and function as expected. Camera is a bummer, video call may seem lifeless as your image is very pixelated and too much Chromatic aberration are present. Keyboard feels sturdy and inspite of having good key travel it doesn't makes much noise, it has baklit as well which is whitish blue in color and has two levels but they are barely differentiable. Ports are enough for business use and the type C does supports power delivery to laptop, provided you have a 65 Watts charger. You will get barrel pin 65w charger in the box. Ram is not upgradable but is in dual channel configuration of 4×2 at 3200 Hz , it's more than enough for office use and just enough for entry level and mid range games. Radeon Vega 7 graphics are integrated which will use upto 520 mb from RAM but frequency is 1600 Hz . Audio output is okish, don't expect much from the speakers on board. Windows 10 home and Microsoft office student 19 are validated for lifetime . These are the only software this laptop comes with. Screen is sufficient for daily consumption of entertainment, casual gaming and video calls, but since the srgb ranges from 45-55 , it's better to look for better screen if you are a consumer of color manipulation softwares. Wifi and Bluetooth are version 6 and 5 respectively, and they work as expected. I bought this laptop for 58595 INR. There are a lot of negative reviews for Appario retail, but my product was neatly packed and arrived in factory condition. I would advise you to check whether your invoice contains the same serial no. as inscribed on your product or device, if it matches then you are sorted with warranty claims in future. This device comes with 365 days of onsite warranty but somehow my system shows its having 11 months left while checking on the day of unboxing ( don't matters much to me). Over all if your budget is 60k , this is the best offering and is a very powerful machine. I have not weighed this machine but to give you an idea it comes somewhat near to 1.5 kgs (roughly equal to a Collins full size dictionary) Cons- Camera is a mess ,RAM(8 GB soldered , non expandable), screen is a bummer only for professional colour correctors, integrated graphics ( for intensive gamers),speakers ( for people with no third party audio device to pair)."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,I don't know...wtts the issue...is...bt within 10 dayz...it's heating like hell...

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"I got this laptop, removed Windows & installed Ubuntu 20.04.2, as this was the only way I could get decent specs for a proper development machine. I've earlier used Apple Macs, Lenovo E series, Lenovo T series and other random HP & Dell machines.  Build quality - Better than low range HP & Dells but slightly lower than the Lenovo Thinkpad series machines. - Touchpad is okay-ish, keyboard key-travel is nice but not as nice as older Thinkpad - Some people have claimed that hinge construction is poor and it overlaps with some components.  OS compatibility Pros: - If you'd stick with Windows10, you wouldn't face any issues - Battery backup is great on Windows10 & nice on Ubuntu too. - Bluetooth & WiFi just works, range, speeds, everything are great on Kernel 5.8+ - It takes 10seconds to show the login screen on Ubuntu, and maybe 5secs to shutdown, I've only installed a few popular Jetbrains IDEs and Docker. This is blazing fast and it sort of shadows the minor driver bugs which would likely get fixed in about a year. - This laptop comes with 1-year premium warranty & likely phone support(I don't need it).  Cons: - As of March 2021 & Kernel 5.8 everything generally works most of the times, there are minor bugs which need to be fixed, AMD seems to be working on them and things are getting better but even they get fixed with a reboot - 2 out of 10 times there are some issues like video & audio playback stutter, blank screen after wakeup from sleep, brightness control issue can be fixed with minor hacks. - Battery does drain when the laptop is on sleep, it dropped like 20% in 3hours, maybe. - amdgpu drivers usually have crappy driver support & there are no proprietary drivers but things are getting better and very soon AMD will be the first choice for linux users. - My laptop warranty began on the day I purchased the product and not on the day I received it, it began a month ago, but Lenovo folks fixed it when I sent out an invoice :(  Conclusion: - This is a decent development machine with 8core CPU & NVMe SSDs & 8 GB RAM. - This is an okay business laptop, the looks are nice, wouldn't recommend it for kids as they might drop it. - This configuration is not available on Lenovo India website, buy! buy! buy! This is a really awesome combination of hardware, software bugs will eventually get fixed, no worries on that front."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I am giving 5 star so it should be up.I facing Display flicker issue for the same it is in the attachment you can check flickering and I raised concern with lenovo. I got a DOA certificate for replacement and now lenovo is saying to replace from Amazon and Amazon is saying to replace from Lenovo.They are saying Amazon is third party site so we cannot provide replacement.Amazon is asking for Service Denial letter from Lenovo to proceed.Lenovo is not providing the letter since they are saying we have given DOA now amazon should replace.You won't get proper service if you buy through Amazon
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Thanks to Amazon, after a few follow-ups Amazon support team has provided good support and refunded the amount. There was no delay in the delivery of the product but it took 14 days to refund my amount which was very challenging to control my stress. First I have requested for replacement but the delivery Agent cancelled the request without proper communication which was a very bad experience and complained to Amazon support, I hope Amazon should take action on that kind of delivery agents who suffers the customers. Product Feedback: Maybe I have received the defective laptop. After many reviews on Youtube, I decided to buy this model but somehow it's not working for me."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Look and weight are impressive. I am comfortable with the price tagged. I got the configuration which i expected. Rizen performance is so good. It was proved, gives more performance than i7 of Intel. RAM 8GB is Good which will meet my requirements but it was soldered and no scope for enhancement SSD 512 GB HD and its performance to so satisfactory. Weight is featherlite and comfortable to carry and move. Planning to expand the disk size to 1TB. Planning to add 512GB SSD. I hope Type C port for charging/data transfer would meet my expectation. I need to check it and confirm. Backlit key board will glow once at bootup time, if required by pressing ""Fn"" key + ""Space bar"" all the keys will glow with backlit. This feature is available where the space bar key has ""light symbol"". By pressing the same keys, the backlit glow can be set to off as backlit will have impact on life of battery power. All other ports, USBs, HDMI, Memory Card Reader, Type C, power are working fine. NIC port should have been added but not exists. Keyboard is OK to handle but navigation keys (up and down) are so close causing some inconvenience for handling. Warranty is for one year from the date of Activation. Display Resolution is also good and satisfactory. Comfortable Brightness. Mic and Camera working fine but quality still to be improved. Camera shutter prevents untoward incidents. When connected to power Top lid gives gentle shock with mild vibration may be due to earthing issue. This would not hinder operations. Battery life is a highlight and more performansive than others in this category."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Everything is fine & awesome for the price we pay. But if you rub the lid when the laptop is charging you can feel some current, it goes away if you unplug it. I returned the first laptop and the new replaced product has the same issue. I read some more reviews and came to know it is because of plastic ground pin in the charger.  Very disappointed as this issue is definitely intolerable and I cannot return it now."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"I'm satisfied with the product ,Lenovo has done great job ,the build quality is good ,I have been using it since a month now ,it gives 7-8 hrs of battery life including my online classes and some research and just some YouTube.the speed is good and thats expected with the processor in it ,overall a good buy I would say."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Overall it's perfect but I am having an issue with the yellowish tint on the screen. It is not too bad but there is some tint.

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"1. 2019 Office has limitations while working offline. So don't trust description 2. Lenovo has very poor customer service support. 3. Lenovo says you have premium laptop and premium customer service which I regretted after purchasing. 4. I called for some technical support during different times on different days but nobody responding. 5. Think after purchasing Rs.63,000 laptop I am getting such service with in 1st week what will happen in future."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"I bought this laptop. I was not statisfied with the product as it was small for my hours taking coding purpose. So when I asked them for refunding they told according to their policy you can't refund an electronic device. So after you buy, they don't care whether you are satisfied with the product You will have eye strain if you want to use it for coding for long hours due to its size If you want it buy it from a store. The outer cover was torn when I got it from supplier. Pictures below. There is a heating issue even when typing in word"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"I bought this laptop especially for the Ryzen 4700 processor which is really hard to get at this price point. This is my honest review after using this for about 4 months: Build: Super build quality. Very compact and light in weight. No creaking or bending happens even when you push it. Only one small thing, the laptop lid opening could have been smoother for one handed operation Performance: This is the USP for this laptop. Ryzen 4700 is superfast and handles almost anything you throw at it with ease. The SSD helps with the speed tremendously. It takes 5 seconds to boot up which is amazing. I didnt game on this but i am guessing the processor can take that up as well. All applications run smoothly and there is no lag even when multiple applications are open simultaneously. Other pluses: lifetime free office 2019 which is a great addition and free upgrade to window 11 will also be available. Stereo speakers with clear distinction and front firing speakers to avoid any muffling. Cons: The camera is simply horrible. it gives grainy images even in best lit conditions. low light performance of the camera is abysmal. Camera is the weakest thing in this laptop. The battery life is also not that great. I was getting about 5-6 hours of uptime without charge. But the charger is fast charger. Also i wish it had USB C type charger instead of the normal one. The speakers are fairly decent. Not very loud and punchy. Overall, for office work (apart from video calls) and normal day to day useage, this is a great buy."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Its a complete package for professionals as its sleek, portable and powerful. It does all your important office work and even lets you enjoy basic gaming on the other hand.  Great matt finish on the top with the metallic upper body.  Awesome keyboard with suitable backlight. The battery performance is decent!  The speakers are on the weaker side, but does the job at times depending on the media.  Connectivity options are great! Fingerprint reader is amazingly fast and the touchpad is also smooth.  For the people who love good screens, this one delivers the HD content really beautifully and yeah, it has great viewing angles. Go ahead and watch your favourite shows and movies on it. Its not very bright for outdoors, but won't even disappoint you completely.  I am a professional technical writer and have to run multiple tools and do a bit of coding as well. It has proven to be a perfect fit for me.  You can go for it blindly if you are looking for a portable, sleek and handy laptop."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Misleading images...no usb c charger in the box , barrel pin charger given in the box. No barrel pin dc in port in the images but there's clearly one on the laptop...extremely annoying, now I have to spend another 3.5k to get a 20v 3.25amp USB c charger."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Except for the fact that 16GB variant was not released in India at the time of purchase, it the greatest in this price range without a doubt.  The only cons that come to my mind: 1. It's srgb rating is around 54% or something so basically not for you if you are a content creator with a need for colour accuracy. 2. 16 GB RAM is not available and 8GB RAM is soldered so, RAM not upgradable. So if you don't fall into the category that has a extreme need for them, then just go for it.  Now then lets answer some obvious concerns regarding a laptop: It has a metal outerbody so doesn't flex. It has a empty m.2 NVME SSD slot. Battery is long enough. Keyboard is great and so is the track pad. It is upgradable to Windows 11(for free of course. Just keep the windows updated and it will eventually show the upgrade when released.) It is not noisy. The speaker are good, as for loudness, windows laptops never specialized in this area did they? Lol. But it is loud enough. Webcam...don't expect something magical, its just enough for video call purposes and such things. Because laptops don't specialise in this area due to demand for thinner bezels. Mic is clear.  Well, these are the concerns that I remembered on the spot and answered, I will try to update it if I remember something else.  And for the ones new to this AMD Ryzen 7 is a processor that is supposed to rival Intel core i7 but ryzen 7 generally is a better choice as it performs better for better price and lesser power consumption. This is because they use 7nm chips while intel still uses older ones, and SSD is always better than HDD. You can always confirm this on internet."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Guys please do a full testing on the new laptop for defects and issues pls dont blindly trust these people as I had worst experience with 2 laptops buying from Amazon. Pls pls dont assume things and keep the laptop do a test and then come to conclusion.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Excellent product, light weight, very fast, doesn't heat up, and long lasting battery. No problem is using it continuously for 6-7 hours to attend online classes."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It's sleek, lightweight and fast! Bootup time is like 6-7 seconds and runs smoothly with multiple applications running in the background. It could easily run Adobe apps and games(wouldn't recommend) on low-medium settings. The screen is too good and It can 4k videos too. It also gives you lifetime access of MS Office. Battery life is decent, enough to last a day or two easily (depending on your usage) for for your college/work activity in one charge. Speaker is great. Camera quality is ok if you have lights."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Great product
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"1. Design I consider Lenovo’s ThinkPad series to be the absolute benchmark when it comes to productivity-oriented laptops. For the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, Lenovo has tried to bring some of that robust and practical design to this meant-for-the-masses laptop. And safe to say, Lenovo makes this rather uninspiring laptop appeal in flesh. This has got a full metal body but with a luxurious “ThinkPad-esque” matte coat of paint for the deck. 2.Display The IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, as the name suggests, comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. There’s support for a 45 percent NTSC color gamut and it can go up to peak brightness levels of 300 nits. The refresh rate stays standard at 60Hz, which seems alright given that this isn’t a gaming PC. 3.Battery With its 3-cell 57Wh battery, the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 is rated to last up to 11 hours at a stretch. In the real world though, I found the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 lasting on an average of 7-8 hours on a regular working day with my kinds of abovementioned workloads, i.e. 9-10 tabs on Chrome with a constant connection to Wi-Fi networks. The 65W adapter tops up the battery from 30 percent in under an hour. Additionally, I was also able to charge the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 using a 65W OnePlus USB-C power adapter. 4. Performance Happy to report that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14-inch feels snappy and handles multitasking very well. Working with 10-15 tabs open in Chrome at the same times proves to be no issue, even when editing spreadsheets at the same time. The Ryzen 4000-series chip is behind this impressive performance, and in Cinebench the 4700U competes with the Intel Core i7-7700K. Even more impressive, GeekBench 5 gives us a single-core score of 1,092 which is on par with the Intel Core i5-9400F, and the multi-core score of 4,800 even beats the same chip with a noticeable margin."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,The laptop is gives me good experience. nice keypad. track pad gestures are giving fast work experience. IPS Display giving crisp and clear screen. Colors are great. Speakers giving good sound quality. Wifi 6 connectivity great connectivity. never feels like working in Wifi.  Cons. Laptop comes with only two USB ports. that also in right side only. No USB in left side. No option to choose OS type while purchase. It comes with Windows 10 Home edition only.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Superior product by Lenovo. excellent build quality considering its price point. NV Me SSD and AMD Ryzen 4700u processor is a deadly combination . Its lightning fast. It powers on so fast that it felt like unlocking a phone. Very lightweight and ultra portable, excellent backlit keyboard also. The key travel and clicking is satisfactory. Color accuracy is not good but you cant expect anything better at this price range . Overall go for it blindly."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"overall nice spec in this budget. Thanks amazon for delivering this product in same day that is just in 9 hrs. Prons: 1.

Cons: 1. non upgradable 8 gb ram, camera quality is below than average, UP-DOWN arrow keys are two small for operation"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,The processor can hardly support games that was launched in 2014 at medium settings. The games start to lag after sometime. HP 5500u handled the Game much better.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,The processor is quite powerful since it's an Ryzen 7 but the igpu with 8 GB ram is not ideal I would be better if we had atleast 12 GB and at max 16 GB ram but it's has not updragability option I love the IPS display and lights in the keyboards the only drawback is the ram which affects the igpu's potential
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Brightness is good enough matt finish works great. Camera is ok but it can be better. Processor is great. GPU is great but u may consider its really less storage if u go for high-end gaming or video editing. Battery life is good enough. NOTE:- Ram isn't upgradable.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,The battery life is too good approx 6-7 hrs .on full charge. Camera is Ok for your regular vedio calls. Brightness is good. Over all a good laptop for business and daily use. A higher end laptop at cheap price.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Warranty was only for 9 month instead of 12 month as claimed. Very poor support from Amazon even after raising complaint against seller.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Software not installed as committee. Not at all satisfied with the Amazon and Lenovo.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Amazing Product! Crazy boot speed, camera is average nothing great. Zoom and hangouts call are okay in terms of quality.  Processing speed is out of the box fast, I run SQL servers, Python Jupyter and Excel all three, and there has been no drop in speed whatsoever."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  with 8gb Ram and 512 GB SSD paired with AMD ryzen 7, it can almost do anything you want. But some small things like, an absence of Ethernet port or ok quality camera are noticed. Besides this, this is a really good laptop ."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"This baby resembles Mac book. Glare free screen, smooth running of MATLAB, decent sound n camera quality. Perfect for students who multitask. Been a week. Loving it so far."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Overall it's a good laptop for office and personal use. Easily handles 20+ tabs,multiple browsers, spotify, and microsoft office apps running in background. Sound quality and display are quite nice for the price."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Writing this review after 20 days of purchase Camera quality is normal Battery life around 4-5 hrs Booting is very fast less than 10 sec If you are ok with 8gb ram then go for it as ram can't be upgraded in future
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Not good
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Light weight, fast and good display. Performance is fine. The delivery was fast. Easy to set up. Good dimensions."

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Excellent. Processor is very good, has 8 cores. Just go for it. Cons: none."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Value for money
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"The laptop is so good. Perfect, just perfect."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Good Performance... battery life could have been better...camera quality avrage ....processing speed is good....

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Good Camera Quality.....impressive battery life......Very light
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"All good except camera and screen are lacking,and trackpad is too small"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,It's USB ports are so much tight.....and it heat in simple browsing....

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Just look at the specs, you can't get anything better than this for under 60K right now. Just wow."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Nice laptop...I will give 5 star
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,best ever laptop. superfast.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Nice product for study daily
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Really portable but a bit fingerprint magnet
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Its really compact and cool. Just how i expected it to be
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Camera not working after two weeks
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Battery drains very quickly.

Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,It is awesome
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Best in the budget
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Amazing laptop under 60k.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,satisfied.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,An 8 core processor for the price is an amazing value! This is gonna be a king in productivity related tasks and you could even squeeze in some gaming. AMD 4000 series is the revolution!
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,I need not to decribe the specs again as they r perfectly same as described by the Amazon and lenovo.  This laptop which is 14 inch is very much uniquely designed . I say it's unique in design because the laptop is pretty good with more width and the length is slightly reduced to 15mm less than the actual 14 inch laptop. So Overall the screen is 14 inch but u have a wide look to the laptop. There is no unwanted space anywhere below the screen .it's perfectly solid to our view.  When it comes to the keyboard . there's not much to say . It's good. U have background keyboard light u can make it on or off .  Please don't look for a fingerprint laptops which are designed with small sqaure size seperately are pretty old tech when it comes to laptops because we now have the windows hello fingerprint which is working excellent on the power button it self.  Speakers according to me are excellent guys . I loved it .. never expected. Dolby atoms killed it. Don't expect bass in laptops guys. It's a stupid thing to think off especially in laptops  Boot speed is less than 10 sec . Speed is marvelous.  Battery is not bad. 6 hrs of usage is what I am getting.  Keypad is Smooth and must be fine for everyone  Cons:::::  Webcam is not that good.  I feel battery should have been improved  Display should have been better.  Automatic on when open the lid. But this is a pros for some. But if u do not want it u can change it in the bios .  The lid is aluminium but the keyboard side is hard core plastic In grey color which is fine  Biggest Pro:  Guys this is -----RYZEN 7 4700---------with 8 cores 8 threads is the biggest Pro for this laptop . This is more powerful than core i7
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"bought this same model for 59k at croma offline store. best ultrabook for the money, no heating issues. Avg battery life. only the top lid is made of aluminium. No considerable flex on the chassis.  webcam quality is bad and speakers output is to low. rest is very good, only 14 inch variant available although lenovo release 15 inch version also. Better to go for AMD laptops rather than intel's pricy ones.  .. lots of useful shortcut keys on the function row .. supports HDR, HDR content from youtube looks dope. .. battery charges fast if fast charge is enabled and gives a backup of 6-7hr of usage time. .. the product comes with only 321days of warranty not 365 days. as soon as u login countdown starts inthe lenovo vantage app. .. keyboard and trackpad are good, gestures work flawlessly"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Great Laptop with 4700u processor. It has good quality screen and is really fast. Ram even though dual channel (big plus for ryzen!) is non upgradable, so keep that in mind for your use case. Speakers are also mediocre but laptop speakers usually are.... I bought it from Lenovo website for 57k after card discount. It's a great purchase for sub 60k."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Okay,so if you are a student and a casual gamer tis thing is not gonna disappoint you ! Ryzen 4700U is seriously powerful chipset you can compare it to new mac M1 chips. PROS: booting time is crazy fast <5 seconds (faster than any laptop in this range i can bet) day to day work like opening up browser,VS code ,whatsapp runs like breeze (doing such tasks uses only 10-15 % of cpu) screen is bright enough (300 nits) and better than swift 3 or Tuf A15 GTA runs on avg 40 fps in LOW settings VALORANT runs at around 120-160 fps(LOW) based on the place you are in the game. runs coooool (havent crossed more than 85C in any game) the keyboard is fantastic(tactile and rounded switches as you find on thinkpad series)  CONS; deck of the laptop (palm rest area) is kinda rubbery which takes a lot of fingerprints and its frustrating to clean it regularly. speaker is loud but bass response is not good :(  if you are not a gamer then you can consider this as it is one of the fastest at 60k price ."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"This is the best ultrabook in terms of processing power. The only downside is you cannot upgrade RAM. If you get this for anything less than 65k from a good seller go for it. It is surely worth the money, a lot better than any Intel i7 ultrabooks."
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,"The processor is slow or it might be because of the Dell Support Assist, but during any multimedia playback there's a significant lag and the audio/video goes electronic stutter. One cannot even do Zoom meetings, Google Meet without the stutter. I tried installing the fresh OS but Windows auto-detects the system and installs the Dell Support Assist, even if you uninstall the support assist the stutter is still there. Don't buy unless you absolutely don't want to play any multimedia."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"The product is absolutely fine, with the exception of the soldered RAM (which is still manageable). Also good value for money with the help of a really good Ryzen processor.  The problem is with the way warranty is implemented. Clearly the distributor bought inventory begining of the year and hence warranty start date in Lenovo system is January 1. This fact is hidden from the customer, and its only when you register the product with Lenovo for warranty you find out the early date of warranty.  Amazon call centre has no clue, and asks you to deal with Lenovo directly, even though it is sold by Appario, which is an Amazon company. It takes some effort to get it sorted out with Lenovo, though fortunately it got resolved.  This has been the experience of many others when buying notebooks, so begs the question why Amazon cannot upfront define the process and give directions on how to resolve the warranty start date?"
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,PERFORMANCE i was very keen for laptops and when it was the time that i should have to buy one i have searched a lot when i want for performance i was recommended to go for gaming laptop but i hate to carry gaming laptops due to thier wieght so after a long search i have found the best from the rest and that was nothing but this LENOVO IDEAPAD SLIM 5 RYZEN 7 4700U the processor itself is a beast and after using this laptop for almost a month the only thing that came into my mind was cmon ajit u have made the best choice and yes this processor is impecable reagarding performance why to bus a intel i5 11th gen when it costs around 66k but with oonly 4 cores and a ryzen 7 with 8 core processor just think.The only drawback about this laptop is that the ram is soldered so i can simply say that A BEAST THAT HAS BEEN LIMITED.and if you are looking for the best performance at resonable price no doubt go for this coz u gonna regret it later and one main point regarding battery if u do gamimg then it rests at 1.5 hr other than that it easly gives a battery backup around 5 to 6 hrs which is more worthy and thats my review and my experice regarding this beast a great thanks if u find it worthy
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Pros : Ryzen 7, 90% active area & FHD Screen, 300 nuts brightness, 72% srgb colour(not sure about this), and really a great Anti glare display.  Cons: 8gb soldered RAM, not so good design, not durable charger cable."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,In future for 3500Rs 8gb will buy new laptop? Don't go with asus and lenovo. Nobody buys a laptop for 1 year
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"The laptop is really very good for work. I use it for my online classes with my students with zoom. Compared to other laptops which I own, the battery life is really good. Camera I feel should have been more clear. But overall I will suggest the laptop to be bought..."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,This AMDs national sales manager whose name starts with P is the most abusive person in IT industry. He would abuse all his employees and drive sales. Worst of a human specimen. Cheap that the company rewards him constantly without probing into his behaviour.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Good Build Quality. Solid Performance. 5-8 sec Booting times. Type C charging and reverse charging. Very nice keyboard. 14"" screen with near zero bezels."
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,Amazing laptop in this price.
Lenovo-Keyboard-Fingerprint-Graphite-82LM009AIN,laptop,"Bootup in 1-2 seconds, light weight, super fast, battery is 6-7 hours. Display is nice, opens all apps in no time. Easy to carry."
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,"Prices of computer parts have gone up by 15 - 25% across all categories and will probably rise further. To get a Laptop of this performance grade and at less than 35K was a bit of luck. The laptop comes with a Ryzen 3250U CPU with a performance score of 4135 points which is nearly 2x of the Pentium Gold 4417U CPU (score: 2242 points) that is featured in the Acer Laptop currently used for daily work with no problems.  The Laptop also features NVME 256GB Storage which delivers over 2.5 GB/second read-write performance. It also features 8 GB DDR RAM. It also features legit Windows 10 64-bit Home Edition Operating System. The overall combination leads to a computer that is really quick to boot and get productive. Applications start almost instantly. Many applications, browser tabs can be opened simultaneously with no noticeable delay as you switch between them. The laptop also comes with Wi-Fi AC and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity.  The display is a 15.6"" Screen with Full-HD resolution. Windows 10 applies 125% upscaling by default. You can restore this to 100% if you are ok with tiny text but a lot more text.  The Laptop comes with MS Office 2019 Home & Student edition. To activate, make sure that when setting up Windows (on first boot), you have Internet access available (via Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and you sign-in to a Microsoft Account. You can create a Microsoft Account at the time of setting up or use one that you have created in advance. Email IDs like hotmail.com / outlook.com / live.com etc. are Microsoft accounts.  If the Windows is set-up using a Microsoft Account, Microsoft Office also gets activated automatically and the licenses of both are associated to the Microsoft Account. In future, even if you were to format the laptop and re-install Windows and Office, both will get automatically re-activated.  If you set-up Windows without a Microsoft Account, or delete the trial of Microsoft Office 365, then you will not be able to activate Office 2019 license. Also note that you will be activating Office 365 License initially, but it will be correctly converted to Office 2019 on subsequent Word / Excel / PowerPoint launches and product-updates.  Let me know if this review was helpful"
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,"Hello team, please assist me While login in Microsoft getting error for product key..please let me know the procedure to get the product key .As it was already mentioned in the specification while purchasing .but now I am not able to find the product key.."
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,Good build quality Laptop in rs 33590 (GST included) 8 GB Ram and SSD is great for office work not good for gaming Excel & adobe acrobat pro 6 work very fast No1 for office and home use Full HD screen is plus others are only HD ready not good with same price range
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,"Hi, I would like to tell this laptop doesn't work. Just simple one application running laptop is hanging 5 times in 5 hour. And no choice other than Reboot. As latptop came in use post 4th June ( for my son's classes) ,we have not used that before. And when started hitting hanging issue, contacted DELL for resolution. Performed all h/w test and installed OS 2 times, as per there guideline. But no help. I know we have crossed the deadline of return , but I would be happy if Amazon can take this complaint and replace my laptop. I am ok to buy better one and pay the difference. Thanks Amazon. I suggested all please don't buy this junk model, or any DELL laptop."
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,"Wanted a laptop for my daughter's online classes but didn't want to spend more than 30-32K. After lot of research, bought this Dell and I am extremely pleased with its performance. -- BATTERY LIFE is about 3-4 hrs which is acceptable. -- BOOT TIME is 7-8 seconds which is awesome. -- PERFORMANCE is above average. Runs all day to day applications without a hitch. I even run some older games like DOOM 2017 at highest settings. -- Comes with Office and Windows 10 preloaded. -- THE ONLY PROBLEM is that it only has a 256 GB SSD. The free space you get is only about 150 GB. If you want a everyday use laptop, look no further !!"
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Faulty keyboard. Mismatch in key pressed and display. Did not check early and return period is over
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,I bought it at 34k and for the price it's a great deal but but but..... I've faced two problems 1st. Heating- It heats up a lot even in a decent temperature then imagine using it in 40°C+ temperature 2nd. Backlight bleeding- Display feels more like TN panel & in black backgrounds screen bleeds a lot.  Conclusion- It's an absolutely great deal if you are searching for a decent laptop under 35k for work but if you are looking one for media consumption then stay away from it. I'll give 3.5/5 to this laptop
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,Working good. On the first day there was some problem with MS teams as it started hanging. But with Zoom app it has been working fine from last 7-8 days. No hanging problems with zoom even after using it straight for 4-5 classes. I also watched 3 movies straight on it from Amazon Prime without facing any problem.
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Laptop is preety good but a little heating problem. Works quick and fast. For a college student it is best choice. This laptop is multitasking like gaming, Editing, official works etc."
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,"Good laptop,fast boot ,everything works fine"
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,I'm writing this review after 15 days of daily use. This machine works perfectly without any performance issues. Ideal for multitasking and office use. Also best device for entertainment purposes. The only issue i found is with the speakers sometimes it has distortion not expected from brand like Dell. AMD Ryzen 3 with 8 gigs of ram makes it faster than intel i3 10th gen Boot time less than 30 secs Overall if you are on tight budget of 40k go for it without any hesitation. Value for money 💯
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,Pros 1.Just ✌️ two secounds to openup desktop. 2. 8 GB of RAM 3. SSD is super fast express  Cons 1. Price is too high.i brought this for Rs.35790 I think 30k is enough. 2. Battery backup is not upto mark but it's not less than other segment laptops. 3.heating issues sometimes.
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Being from Dell I was expecting good performance as the configurations were quite good but it was not able to run a single app i.e. MS Teams. Every 20-30 mins I have no other option except force restart. Finally in 3 days of ordering it I placed a return request which was nicely fulfilled by Amazon.
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,Booting time was almost 4-5 seconds only . Only after 4-5 days it will start hanging a little Even small games was lagging sometimes . Camera quality was very bad. Only a week used so can't tell much will update later after a month . No heating issue found still . Only good for normal use of students and office. Not for gaming even San Andreas will lag
Dell-Inspiron-Integrated-Graphics-D560428WIN9BE,laptop,The mouse pad is not working and also Amazon's process of returning a faulty product is too cumbersome. There was a technician deployed to check the product and technician never visited our site and without even visiting gave a report that the laptop is working fine.

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Its superfast. Battery is atleast 7 hours. Go for it . Only drawback is no backlit keyboard but its manageable for me.
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1115G4-Integrated-TP470EA-EC301TS,laptop,"I believe I am the first reviewer of this product. 2020 Vivobook comes with i5 and i3. Though there are reviews available for11th gen i5 but no reviews available for 11th gen i3. Before buying it in Amazon I visited couple of Acer exclusive store and called rest of them in my locality. Unfortunately none of them this one. Either they have 10th generation i3 or 11th gen i5. Finally placed the order in Amazon. This after exchanging with my old HP i3 got a good deal. It costed me around 43k. I need it for daily use and I must say it is amazing. Looks neat and compact, weighs 1.5 kg which is alright. It comes with thunderbolt c type port, stylus pen, harman kardon powered audio, nanoedge display, backlit keyboard and many other features. It is extremely handy where one can use both keyboard and touchscreen as and when required. Will update review again after couple of months."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1115G4-Integrated-TP470EA-EC301TS,laptop,"Well specified for the price point. 14"" is pretty nice to have as 2 in 1.  Touch ID, Keyboard Backlit, Stylus Pen make it premium. Build quality is excellent, feels quite sturdy in hand. With SSD and no bloatware, it boots up in a snap.  Go for it."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1115G4-Integrated-TP470EA-EC301TS,laptop,"Just the first impressions : This 2 in 1 from ASUS is quite solid in build quality. Does not have any spoilers. Comes with sturdy stylus. Looks pretty cool. Has a crystal clear screen and quite powerful speakers. Has a metallic lid. Performance is quite fast right now. Just the Microsoft and MyAsus registration part is not so smooth and straight-forward. Asus can add a printed manual with some basic instructions, at the least.  Will modify this review after working with this laptop for some time."
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1115G4-Integrated-TP470EA-EC301TS,laptop,A perfect laptop for daily use. You can use it a tablet if u want for entertainment purpose. Perfect for online learning. You can play games at medium setting without any lag
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1115G4-Integrated-TP470EA-EC301TS,laptop,"The laptop is great for a running a business apps with 10-15 tabs open at the same time + few office apps. You have to adjust the screen settings, but the videos and content is displaying in 1080 resolution. Again sound output is great! The laptop is pretty silent and makes no noise at all. Overall an awesome laptop to buy under 50K range!"
ASUS-VivoBook-i3-1115G4-Integrated-TP470EA-EC301TS,laptop,"Good for day to day activities and online classes, kids will enjoy."

MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,Simply loved the laptop. My first experience of an amd processor. Not disappointed at all. Very smooth. No heating issues. Upgradable to 64 GB ram. Colors are good. Build quality is very good. Overall I loved it.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"Everything is fine, this machine is powerful. Heating issue is there but can be solved by using an improvised stand and cooler boost in Dragon Center."
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,There are no video driver available linux. If you still try to use dual boot then cause too many issue. It's litle bulky to handle. Battery last for 2-3 hrs. Battery charging is very slow. Not suitable for travel.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"Don't buy MSI , worst after sales you ll ever get. It's better to go for conventional brands. I am done with these service center guys. If you still want to buy MSI just vist Quora and check MSI after sales service you ll understand why I am telling you to buy conventional brand laptops"
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"Though it's a gaming laptop, I only use this for my work and have opted for the hardware MSI has bundled together within the price range that I'm looking for. And it was a tough call due to few negative reviews that I came across on youtube but now I do not have to repent looking at the performance and the battery backup I'm getting. And all those reviews are big trash for me now :)  CPU & WIFI 6 - With 8 cores and 16 threads, I would say it's a beast considering the price band for this laptop. Its performance is comparable to that of an I7 10750H. And the processing is pretty good and sometimes while working on the web apps it gives me an impression that they are desktop apps. Temperature/Heating: With Room temperature at 25°C CPU temperature is constantly between 34°C and 37°C when the power cable is not plugged in, which is pretty decent. But, when put on charge it is very high at 59°C which is the only cause of concern. Battery - Have set the battery setting to Balanced from Dragon Center and the power mode to ""Better Battery"" and with this setting, I'm getting a very decent 5+ Hrs from a full charge of 80% charge. Display - With the power mode and battery settings my screen would look a little dull. But Display is much pleasing after adjusting the settings. But then you may have to compromise on the battery. Graphics - I do not use this for gaming at all so I do not have much to comment about the performance of this 5500M Radeon Graphic. Again I saw few reviews not in favor of this graphics card so better cross-check if you are buying this just for Gaming.  Future Ready with the following Hardware Upgrades : Comes with 2 SODIMM slots that support up to 64GB DDR4 RAM @3200 MHz Add on slot available for extending storage capability. You can add either a SATA an NVME M.2 module and extend the storage.  Cons Though the display seems to be alright now, I noticed the flickering on the initial two days of use which did not happen later. Did anyone else notice something similar? Also for some reason, I see a color variance and missing clarity while watching the youtube videos. TrackPad: There are no buttons and it's a little tricky it's not like clicking but tapping it hard at the trackpad for left and right clicks. Might be by design but MSI should consider fixing this for their next builds. Keyboard Layout: Comes with a short keyboard layout with big keys. Got used to the long keyboard layout so it's a matter of time that one gets used to it. Till then be aware of what you were typing. Material: Looks like very cheap black plastic all over. Heating: Dragon center shows the presence of two fans. But I never saw the other one working. So better check on that."
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,Its too fast.. Value for money  For audio select boost mic option in driver. For heating issue use Cooler boost
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,Nobody! Absolutely nobody gives this much of configuration in this price range. Looks great! Performs great! Go for it. Dont bother about the power backup of 3-4 hours. Nobody works/games on battery! Come on! We all know that!
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"The delivery is good, it is delivered with in 2 days and it is in good package. This is the first time I am using the MSI laptop. I am impressed with the performance, screen size, the booting time is very less and instantly opening all tabs. All configurations are matched with the production description. The only issue l am seeing is no indicator for showing for battery charging except in taskbar."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Good
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"It's too early for me to document this - as still playing around with the new monster. SPEED and PROCESSING are impressive. Had loaded some extreme tools for work and the machine is handling it quite well. I wanted this to be mirrored or extended to SONY BIG screen TV - but the machine lags and mostly freeze the frame whenever plugged in, have checked with installing the HEVC plugin, changing display settings - still doesn't work. While the other windows 10 DELL machine with a lower config works well. And I have hi-hopes for this machine to do this seamlessly. but got disappointed. This also does not picks up WiDi display and BlueTooth audio device.  I am wondering whether it's the PROCESSOR, GRAPHICS CARD, or what is the issue. Couldn't find any resolution on the forums."
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"After all research and 2 months of personal use I found this to be very powerful value for money laptop.. Works great for photoshop ,premier pro and other high end softwares Display is more than average. Antiglare is very useful. When system gets overheated you can turn on cooler booster manually on MSI dragon centre. I got it for 79k :)"
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is the best PC for mid end games and high end for design professional.go for it but you can watch for the price I brought it for 85000 but I saw it on a deal for 76999.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,Only good for casual gaming.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,The laptop is very good with battery capacity of more than 4 hours with basic activities. During gaming it does get heated but I believe it happens with gaming laptops. The display is amazing and MSI has provided many good softwares like Dragon centre which has so many functions like battery calibration. Overall the laptop is a value for money and also the camera quality is good compared to all other gaming laptops at this price range.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,I bought this beautiful gaming laptop a month ago and now i say its a great model. So fast and smooth. Its working great. Its really a beast for gaming with 16 gb ram and super processor. Loved it
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"i got a defective screen but amazon customer care as usual did a wonderful job and replaced the laptop immediately. It Does More. It Costs Less. It’s that Simple. High performance, play game without lag put some form beneath the laptop for air inflow - outflow as it get heat up very fast."

MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,The Laptop is fantastic but they took an extra day for delivery!! If I knew this I would have paid more for an express delivery.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,Nice but you will face issue with charging
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,I am not able to register this product in MSI site with the sl. no
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,"Best for gaming. I hav experienced playing GTA 5, BGMI(BlueStacks), FORTNITE, FIFA 21. All went smoothly. It never lagged at all. The price could be ₹5000 less but it's the best for games and streaming."
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,A good gaming laptop in this price. All other laptops came with same configuration but with extra 10k INR. So its a better choice.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,This laptop is good for gaming as well as productive tasks
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,Value for money. However I do notice some problems with brightness/contrast which comes up sometimes.

Best purchase
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,I think it is the best product in the price range. Have owned the laptop for 3 months now and playing games like WatchDogs and GTA5 with no lag or heating issue. The screen isn't tough on the eye and you can sit for extended periods of time and the battery life holds up as well.
MSI-Gaming-Windows-RX5500M-A4DDR-212IN,laptop,MSI and AMD is deadly combo in budgetary gaming laptop segment. Overall gaming experience is good with Ryzen 4000 series processor and 4GB Radeon Graphics. Expecting a per-key RGB in upcoming Bravo Models. So far happy with the performance.

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I had purchased laptop on 18th June 2020 first day of launch & received on 25th June 2020. After 2 days, OS was updated automatically & I faced Automatic Repair Issue.  I asked for replacement & Amazon promptly replaced 3-4 days. But again after OS update... I am getting same issue."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Day 1. Laptop showed Bluescreen within an hour of use and crashed. Not even able to perform automatic repair on Windows.  Build quality is great and display is amazing, but what good is it if it doesn't work?  Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"One of the best laptop ever used, android studio, emulator,adobe premiere pro working on beast, no lag observed. Rendering time is also commendable."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Speed not up to the mark, No backlit keyboard, No in built cam, Track oad is very cheap in build quality, No lifetime Microsoft office. High on specs but good for nothing. Mi has really disappointed."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Superb quality.. and value for money.. I think best laptop in this budget.. go for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Value for money. Super fast booting, hardly takes 10-12 seconds. Easy to open with one finger, hinges are butter smooth. No complaints about webcam, perfect for video call & online classes for kids. Sleek & handy. Excellent pixel size. Though screen is 14 inches, it gives a large view. Sound quality is good. My rating 3.5 stars because of below cons: No backlit. Scroll pad quality is poor, while you click it gives different 'tik' sound. Battery doesn't last for 10 hrs as what they shown in promotion. Max 5-6 hrs. RAM & SSD can't be upgraded. Charger knob is hard. Very difficult to plug & unplug from laptop. Can't place it on the lap not more than 10 mins, getting hot & makes you uncomfortable."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"When I first saw the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition, I thought the laptop would be as expensive as the Dell XPS 13 or a MacBook Air. It’s got an aluminum build, an extremely comfortable keyboard, latest Intel processors, and a screen with the thinnest bezels in the market. All of those features, I just mentioned, are trademark of any high-end laptop these days. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package.  Pros: - 14-inch FHD Anti-glare display with minimal bezels - Intel Core i7 (10th generation) - 512GB NVMe SSD - Nvidia GeForce MX350 - 1.35kg - Up to 10 hours of battery (practically lasts somewhere around 6-8 hours depending on your work) - Premium looks - Well priced (I won't call agressive pricing though) - Beautiful scissor-style keyboard with 1.3mm key travel  Cons: - No backlit keyboard in 2020 is a crime - Lack of a built-in webcam. Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much - The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age - The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook’s 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board - The audio system on the notebook is weak. The stereo speakers don’t get loud. Plus, they lack bass  The laptop has a good design, better processing power and keyboard than every other Windows laptop in this price bracket. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone within this price bracket."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I used it for 4 days, continuously for 7-8 hrs each day, does not heat much, was able to run Virtual Machine as well using VMware, Ram is not upgradable as its low powered module which is soldered on the board so this is China dumping low end models to India. I saw that in China, similar model with very high end specs in terms of Memory (16-32GB) and SSD capacity (1TB) are also available. Windows is Home version and not Pro which sucks if you like to use RDP on your laptop. There is no backlight in the keyboard which is a crime in 60k, keyboard is very small for people with big fingers, I would say if you have 60k for this, add 15-20k more and go for ASUS gaming model which comes with backlight keyboard and 16GB memory, has 15 inch IPS Screen. I would say this is a good ultrabook for office productivity, and low end games, but if you have to go for long term investment which can be upgraded in future, dont buy this model."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,One should purchase laptop what one should need. It may be not good for other but it is best deal for me. Before buying I went to apple store and local shops. Local shops were selling old asus zenbook. I needed light weight notebook. First of all I am touch typist so I don't need backlight keyboard. So backlight keyboard is not necessary for me. It has scissor mechanism keyboard. It is better than chiclet keyboard. It feels like heaven to type. May be that's the reason that they don't provided backlight. But they should provide backlight keyboard if they could but I am not sure whether scissor mechanism can provide backlight. It has two usb 3.1 gen 1 port which are 5 gbs. I wish they could be usb 3.2 gen 2 but I am not sure. Let purchase me external ssd of usb 3.2 gen 2. Battery life gave whole day. I didn't calculate. I am habitual of low brightness so my battery time will be more. Most of the people are complaining about touchpad. It is flimsy. But they should read manuel. It is flimsy because it gives click sound when you tap it. For right click you have to touch with double finger. I think touchpad is good. It is different and unique from other. Lets talk about processor. The core i7 is beast. All work are superfast. I can't compare with ryzen processor which come with 7nm technology because I don't have one but this 14nm are good. But they do heat. GPU is very good. It's MX350. The best part is SSD . It has toshiba NVME gen 3 SSD which read write speed is 3500 MBps. That's amazing. Other provide SSD upto 1000 MBps. It has intel wireless 9560 card which provide wifi speed upto 1.7 gbps. Who need more speed than that. In India we are getting optical speed of 100-100 mbps. I downloaded games at 250mbps connection and laptop was getting warm. So who need wifi 6? Wifi 6 can support 2.4gbps. Moreover wifi6 it is not sure whether they have put good antenna. If antenna is not good on wifi than there is no use of wifi card. The thing that is missing is type c charging. But the charger supplies charges very fast and we don't have type c fast charger. It has mx 350 so we can play games so we can't charge with type c. Type c cable are short in length due the reason they transmit data and the supplied charger have lot of length. If thunderbolt is needed than buy apple because it has graphic card and one who is buying this can't afford external graphic card or 5k tv. This is budget laptop. If you are complaining about 1.4b hdmi port than mx 350 can support only hdmi 1.4b. You are getting a lot in ₹ 60000. They have kept essential things and removed non essential items and targetted the needs of people of mind. I was skeptical to buy this due to anti Chinese movement but than thought and bought it and reasons I would not share here. I am not anti national to buy Chinese product. There were options like acer swift 5 but they increased the price by 5k and asus vivobook 14 they also increased by 5k. I thought a lot over it and my justification are only justified to me. I don't want to explain to anyone and I am not anti nationalist to buy Chinese product. I don't recommend this product as it is Chinese product but I have bought this product due to my personal reason. I will recommend only if you think about it and you have no issue in buying Chinese product. And the last thing is design. It design is more premium than apple macbook. Its like you are holding macbook. It is lightweight and metal built and carries 1.35 kg. It has 91% screen to body radio which seems so nice but it can't hold webcam. I don't use webcam and I have privacy issue so it is best for me. So the one who are buying for online classes please think before buying. Even I didn't opened the webcam cable.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Pros: 1. Intel Core i7 2.10th Gen 3.Light weight 4. SSD 5.Value for money At this price the same config is not available in other brands Cons : 1.Back lit keyboard, 2. inbuilt web cam but the same is somewhat beneficial too. 3.Lesser storage space, 4.no ms office inbuilt (only one month trial version available) 5.No logo. 6.Small sized up down cursors."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Don't buy it.. company is misleading it's customer. Earthing problem is very often if u work on a table u will feel many shocks in a single day.No protective grill inside laptop which don't prevent motherboard from dust or inside fan from sharp objects like pins.Graphic card is mx350 which is only for games which in terms don't support content creation like youtube videos on obs and other softwares.If u want to buy go for ryzen7 with 8 core processor which takes half the time in tasks like video rendering even the ryzen 5 series perform better than this.Also processor is i7u .u means it is designed to save energy if u want to go for i7 go for i7H and graphic card of rtx series but don't buy mx series because it don't support video rendering otherwise you will regret later.Also full brightness level is quite low, which might be a problem if u want to watch a video."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Plenty of reviews already out there, but thought I should share my opinions on the device as well, since a few questions that I had in mind could not be resolved from the existing reviews, both on Amazon and Youtube etc.  Disclaimer: I'm writing this review after about 25 days of extensive usage. I bought the base variant of the Notebook 14 Horizon during the Prime Day Sale, because it was running on an extra 2k discount and the 7k price difference to the next variant did not seem justified. I got it for 49.5ish thousand after factoring in amazon icici card cashback. Also, the 5 star rating is as per my expectations from the device, since I already knew what I was buying with this package.  Pros: 1. The display is IPS, or at least acts and feels like one. Though Mi website mentions that the laptop has 178 degree viewing angle, I could not find the mention of the display being an IPS one in any official listing. But I can confirm, the display has no viewing angle issues at all, is perfectly bright for the rare time you might need to use it outdoor, and the anti-glare aspect of it works like a charm. 2. Performs really well. I consider myself a non-graphic hungry power user. Android Virtual Device runs butter smooth, more so on Ubuntu/Linux than on Windows.. Apps/software open real quick. Boot time is commendable. 3. Lightweight helps make it super comfortable. If you use your laptop for 10-12 hours a day, you'd know how you end up placing it on your lap (or even tummy? or is that just me?). I was confused between going for a regular thick bodied laptop in the 60k price range that come with much better graphic processing capabilites. But time and again, I find myself feeling glad about my choice. 4. If you think you'd like to play some games occasionally, and 120 Hz 120 fps at ultra settings isn't your requirement, you'd do alright with this one. I played Far Cry 5 and GTA V on this laptop, albeit with low graphic settings, but barely any stuttering, if at all, was felt.  Cons (mostly nitpicking):  1. The minimum brightness of the screen is still too bright. I use Dimmer to lower it further, mostly works except for the still-a-bit-too-bright mouse pointer. (Update: dims to a real low point natively on Ubuntu) 2. I miss the dedicated Home End Page Up Page Down keys that were present on my previous 14 inch laptop. 3. Speaker output is wayyy too low, in that even the voice of a person is barely audible in most youtube videos. I resolved this by opening the DTS Audio Processing app that comes pre-installed with the laptop, and amping up everything in the Graphic Equalizer to the max. Worked wonders to increase the maximum sound output, without causing any noticeable distortion in the sound output. I often find myself keeping the volume at the 70% mark now. (Update: On Ubuntu, install PulseEffects, enable auto gain, set Target to -17 and both Input and Output to 4, for a much louder yet clear sound output)  No BSOD errors till date.  Would update this review if I stumble upon something else. If you want to install Linux/Ubuntu, the option to disable secure boot will be editable once you set an administrator password in the BIOS settings. You can remove that password by entering a blank new password once you disable the secure boot.  Conclusion: For the given price point, at the time of writing (September 2020), I wholeheartedly recommend this laptop, given you know what you are buying. It performs just how you think it would, given its specifications."

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,This review is written post using laptop for a week. I m not a gaming guy.  Laptop is butter smooth. Especially display is awesome. It's Antiglare. Battery is extremely good with atleast 8 hrs backup External web cam is awesome Boot time is less than 5 secs  Best in range.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Best value for money product 👌..received in 4 days in this lockdown period ....feels solid ....very quick in action ... good display ...gives premium feel when you hold it ... under 60k it's the best laptop... backlight is missing but that can be let go as performance is quite good .
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Worst laptop ,better to go other companies"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"This is after almost 10 months of usage. This is a long post but please do read it. You have to know this about their customer care before buying this device  Sound quality and battery life are horrible. The laptop cannot be used without ear phones or external speakers. My power cord stopped working before 1 year of use. My customer care experience has been THE WORST.  I made an appointment on the website at a service centre. When I went to the centre, they said that the company shut down their server. I don’t understand why they booked my slot at this particular centre when they had shut down their server themselves! Talking to customer care agent was useless, as all she did was book another appointment, which I could have very much done by myself.  The second service centre needed 2 days to just figure out what the problem is when it was obvious that the power cord had to be replaced. I had to go up and down almost three times just for this!  Firstly, it is clear on the website and my warranty card that the charger is covered under warranty for one year. I was told it was only for 6 months. After a lot of argument, they were willing to replace it (more like they had no choice). It is taking them more than 10 days to replace a charger that is covered under warranty fair and square despite the fact that there are TWO service centres and a mi showroom here in my place.  There is no kind of status tracking available on the website. The service centre executives will not call you and update you regarding the status. They will make it look it is your job to keep calling them to find out the status. And now, when I called them, they said only half the charger has arrived and the other half is yet to come. Its taking them more than 10 days to get a simple charger replacement!  My laptop has been put of charge since a week and everything is stalled for me. They expect me to go to the centre and get it charged if I want to charge it. What kind of nonsense is this!  I have learnt my lesson. Although the specs are good at a reasonable price, please never go for companies like this that are not trustworthy. Prefer other brands that know what they are doing. These people are even more clueless than us!"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,The laptop is over all very good.:  But few points to note: 1. The sound is not that much good. It will be difficult to listen properly in a conf call/meeting. Specially for our little kids who are doing online classes. We had to use another speaker or head set. 2. The touch pad is little buggy. while moving the mouse pointer it sometime drags objects under it. This might create problem when you are in hurry. 3. Camera was OK. But you have to remember to attach the camera. 4. The battery back up is excellent. But if you are playing game then it drains 50% of battery in 30 minutes. It may be normal in comparison with other laptop but I'm not too sure.  Other than these points still did not find any problem in last 14 days.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,After using Laptop for one week below are my views Pros: 1:Light Weight 2:No heating 3:Premium Look 4:Display also good Cons: 1:Sound Quality could have been better 2:Touch pad is not Good  overall good value for the money
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,One of the best pc in this price range. Battery is enough not bad. It is something allrounder.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,They won't provide you Web Cam when you buy the Product.. It is mentioned that you will get web cam along with the laptop..but you won't receive it.. Amazon or Xiaomi should fix this problem
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Pathetic! It's just been 8 or 9 days and it's not working well now. Today it came to become too miserable to even get shut down and even keys stopped working! I regret I bought it. I don't recommend this to anyone!!
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I had purchased this laptop on first day launch.it is showing amazing performance i have no issues with this laptop, display quality is also good and no lag issues when gaming.i have satisfied with this laptop"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"After searching for one week , 4 hours each day I finally orders this laptop on next day of my 24th Bday for 60k 💥, here's the review  Actually I got admission in IIT Bombay Mtech and needed a laptop which can handle satellite images processing well  Pros :- -Screen is best , display is amazing, 91% screen to body ratio is killer in looks..  -i7 processor is what made me fan of this laptop, as many renowned companies are providing i5 10th gen or below at this price and this is above standards in this price range and futuristic too..  - 512 GB nvme SSD is good as most companies offer 256 GB only in this range .  - Gforce mx350 graphics card is excellent for gaming and my image graphics work too , I personally have played very less games over it but I have seen people on YouTube playing gta5 , pubg smoothly over it .. - Battery life is good , but this will be too early to comment on this but atleast charging rate is fast - light weight and slim , also plain panel of screen is classic look (some may like llogo of apple , etc but I like this classic professional look ) -  Cons :- - NO BACKLIT KEYBOARD , this is absolutely disgusting about this laptop as I personally like keyboard lighting even at not so dark environment and in night it is miserable . So u need time to adjust with this machine and set it hands with keyboard then only u will be comfortable with it as I type after seeing keys and this becomes intolerable sometimes 😁  -Internet runs somewhat slower on it , when I download from ms official site then download speed is better than my phone but from other not so popular sites it shows slower speed , idk why . But YouTube 4k video runs amazingly smooth ..,  - HEATING is not a problem during regular use but as soon as u switch on the game the fans start at its full speed and laptop gets instantaneously hot at hinge part of screen this heat is expected I guess but 2 fans could have better dealt it  - No ms office , free wps office need downloaded -TRACKPAD is not upto the mark for this price , u will need a mouse anyway - sound is low nearly equal to phone - Ram is not upgradable , presently I don't find it a problem but according to many youtubers this is not futuristic and will hamper the full utilisation of i7 processor  Final verdict : If I was to again but a laptop then also I will buy this only as it is a performance oriented machine and I m using MI phone from 2yrs + and still it works like new so I had built a sort of trust in this company now let's see how it fulfills this trust in laptop"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Already started facing number of issues. My NVidia graphics card is not working!!!  You will struggle to get service for the laptop.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"This laptop is feeling awesome like Apple Macbook. I purchased i5 variant. I am not a Hardcore Gamer, not a professional, no any Graphical work. This Laptop satisfy my expectations. Before I used Acer laptop i3 variant which is plastic. But it is Metal which feels great like premium. What a bezel less screen ❤️. without thinking just go for it. No issues found in this laptop. But there are some Cons:- No backlit keyboard. 8gb ram .Not upgradeable. 512gb SSD which is not enough but there ar no extra slot."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Big miss of webcam. Bundled external cam means one USB port used up. Issues of static charge on mouse pad. Quite raw on design elements and not as pleasing as the hp pavilion or vaio in similar price range.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,really great on this price range it is best... when i bought this i didn't no there is dts speaker option from where i increase volume so i don't like that much but there is dts by there we improve speaker and processor is too good opening time is too less and shutdown time too it's really amazing i like it...
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Amazing deal.. value for money.. extremely light weighted.. gives feeling of using Apple Mac.. designed well within the price range which is affordable..
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Trackpad and Audio could've been better. Update:- after using it for 6 months 🌀 the sound breaks horribly sometimes 🌀 it hangs often or freezes even while running only google chrome with one tab 🌀 Mi deceived us about the battery. Full battery shows 11hours and after 20-30 minutes, it falls to 3 hours. This was really shocking 😂"
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Dont buy this laptop screen got white after few days and hanged the excel
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I purchased it a month ago and after doing little test and trail i am writing this review.  Before buying it, i was checking many options, at one point decided to buy Macbook though its little expensive. I read both ptoducts reviews and web reviews by experts. I was scared of 15% reviews which were under 1⭐ ans 2⭐ category of Mi laptop but i have decided to buy this product along with 2 years onsitego extended warranty of around 6k which in hotsl costed me around 63k. Macbook i may have to spend double the ptice for same configuration. I some how feel its not worth.  My First impression was, its pretty little as i was using Dell experia from last 6 years and i didn't feel its worth by its size. When days passing on i realized its pretty handy and i can carry anywhere without having a seperate backback like arrangement. It even fits in your wife's handbag if its size is moderate.  When it comes to performance, i was totally amazed and its look and feel is just wow. I became a big fan of it. It doesn't take mins to boot, just 30 seconds, you can turn on play. I somehow loved its giant performance.  I took this for the purpose of playing/ practicing data science related stuff. Installed tableau, anaconda, java IDE which are heavy and hangs in traditional i3/i4 systems but this laptop served the purpose. Never felt it was taking time. Just a mouse click away. After buying this i realized the quality and bought another MI product (mobile ) for my dad.  I never played games as my purpose is to practice Data related softwares and its eco systems. So i cannot ckmment on how it works for games.  Overall, its a good purchase worth each penny. If you are struggling to pick bedt laptops with this configuration and undr this price bucket. Don't think too much just go for it."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"This is very a good laptop under 60,000 this will give maximum battery for about 9 hours which is great I don't find any cons in this laptop totally good laptop just take a external mouse and you are fully loaded you can go for this one...... happy with this product :)thank you Amazon for delivering this laptop one day before I forgot to told about charging it has the super fast charger which will charge your laptop in just 50 minutes I will give update after one month of usage ...."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Pros :- 1) The build quality of this laptop is sturdy because of metal body. it is very light weight and sleek in design. 2) it looks very premium 3) the quality of webcam is much better than the in built webcam of many laptops 4) it is blazing fast thanks to the NVME SSD .The boot time is about 4-5 sec. App opening time is negligible. the read speed is about 3225 MB/sec. 5) its display is wow because of very thin bezels. 6) this is perfect for day to day tasks. Don't compare this with gaming laptops. 7) battery backup is about 7-8 hrs and charged rapidly. Cons :- 1) doesn't have back-lit key which is the main drawback of this laptop. 2) the quality of touch-pad is average but it is quiet responsive. 3) cannot upgrade RAM and storage.  Overall this laptop is great package under this price range
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Loved the product.....very smooth and powerful laptop....its like the classic dell xps with macbook style .....loved the product but sorry for people who could not be able to buy it ......it got i7 processor which you cannot get in this range of laptops ...... and the cam is good

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,I really liked it.. Awesome performance and very light weight.. Seems like macbook 😜😍
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"WiFi connectivity is always an issue even after many software updates.  Customer care is pathatic when it comes to solving above stated issue ....i.e., WiFi connectivity. The executives are clueless.  As if company knows this issue, no response from their end to resolve the same .... Even after raise multiple queries during the first week of purchase.  Overall laptop is good for machine learning stuff at moderate level.  The processor ditches you while pushers for heavy algorithms.  Speakers are pathatic ... better not to come with one !  For below Rs. 60k .... It's a machine with good hardware and software....but if any issue comes by .... May GOD help you! Mi won't..."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Screen not good . Poor quality of screen brightness and color. Due to major ""screen bleeding"" problem I replaced it for two times and finally I return it because in every piece smajor screen bleeding is found and amazon not return me full money of laptop cost which I pay.I pay for this is ₹49999 and amazon return me only ₹46299."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Very light weight. Beautiful. Good screen.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"See I bought Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition i7-10th gen, Now it has been One month with it. II never experienced any kind of lag, maybe because I don't do heavy video editing.... This laptop is best for Office work , Students , Teachers and Personal use... You can also use this for gaming and video editing also... I'll tell You the Pros and Cons about this laptop...  Pros:-  Processor : I searched all the laptops available in India. Non has i7 with a range of 60k and also you can i7 7th gen for 72.5k.  Storage : It has the latest SSD. I experienced very fast transfer of files in just a while.(I am talking about whole Series about 7-10 GB)  RAM : 8GB DDR4 with 2666 GHz speed.(Just Wow)  Weight : Very Light Weight , You won't even feel that this is with you....  Body : The body is made out of Aluminium which give it a premium look, And its back is purely plane ...(Which mean you can customize as you wish or if you like it plane let it be.)  Boot : You don't have to shutdown every time, you can just lock it or put it in sleep or can hibernate...(I prefer hibernating as it Always takes the work from where we left it and saves the battery very much...)And also it takes 2.1s to boot up.(I have kept BIOS password so it takes longer or it would have been much faster... I just want to say it boots up very fast...)  Graphics card : I have not used the graphic card much so I can't mention anything , but I can say this for sure it would be powerful...  Display : The most interesting part... It has a matte finished Display, which never reflects any reflection as a normal display do... It is very Bright, so I always keep the brightness at 1 unless when I'm sitting under sunlight... It has 91% screen to body ratio...  Fan : While playing any game its fans gets boosted up and runs at the high speed.... This may not happen when you are just Normally using your laptop...  Cons :-  Keyboard : Its doesn't have a backlit keyboard, but I think you don't need a backlit keyboard if you have a very bright screen. if also the brightness is at 1 the whole room brightens up.If you want the focus to be at the keyboard then just tilt your screen ...  Cover : I am not able to find a cover for the screen and touch pad, And also I'm not able to find a back cover or sticker of its size...  Touch pad : It is a little bit small. But it is justifiable as if they give a larger touch pad then they would have to make the laptop much bigger and the bezels would have been larger...  Student : If you are a student who have to keep their camera ON all the time then it would be a Difficulty to carry the camera... If you don't have to keep your camera On all the time then it is best for you... And also without inbuilt camera we get PRIVACY, In the era of Cyber attacks PRIVACY is very important, this makes sure that you don't loose your privacy...  AT THE MOST LAST : this is your choice that which Laptop, who are we to tell you that which one to buy which one to not... The decision is yours... Just check whether the laptop has the features you want or not.... In my opinion you should buy this laptop if you are a Student , teacher , or just for office use or personal use... I would not recommend this for Hard-core Gamer..."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Just received it 2 days ago and hardware is just superb. It gives a rich feeling in first impression.  About negative points:  1) Lots of people saying negative about speaker but genuinely the sound output from the speakers is great it has a surrounding effect and well balanced n uotput is not too loud but good enough to play songs n other things.  2) About track pad : People n reviewer saying it is delicate but trust me it is not that delicate. And it is hardware requirement to function, for that it made like it is a slight free at bottom.  3) About keyboard it is definitely a fun to type on the keyboard, the reviewer are the experts they have upto 150 words/min speed and they gives openion by their thinking but the regular guy who having speed like 40-50 words surely won't find any difficulty.  4) Regarding camera : It just superb for the purpose of video calling. And it is meaant to be a web cam not a photography cam, So it perfectly solve the purpose. If the removal of camera can give the great screen to body then it is thumbs up, It is good decision to remove it.  Positive points:  1. Display ,Boss great experience it just make us to use it more. 2. Keypad, just superb 3. Battery backup is great and I experience it. 4. Waight is just 1.3kg and a very sturdy build to hold 5. Overall a Macbook kind of feel. 6. Superfast.  So finally this laptop is a very great option for regular usage, programming, browsing, Entertainment. Don't buy it for gaming although it can handle the light games like counter strike.  I was planning to buy a laptop from last 1 year and by seeing this just thought I should try it and that decision turned as extremely beneficial."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I got it for 57K with card offers, i7 model. Best value for money product it is. Thin light, even I am getting 10 hours battery life in normal use. Display n looks are awesome. Although SSD n processor perform its range. Only cons are explaining here,  No backlit on keypad  No front cam(that's actually pros, cam won't turn on unless u connect it, even it gives hd quality)  Avg quality of scroll pad  Except this, I would recommend this with 100% satisfaction under this price range. I am completly satisfied except backlit keyboard"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,I saw a worst laptop from mi products .this I don’t expect for mi . Touch pad is worst .don’t buy any one . 😌 to say i have to use this worst product because i spent money on this
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"The mi has made their notebook in such a way that it is good for gaming, but it has a bit issue of heating because it has i5 in it. And also who wants it for day to day life. I've used this computer extensively, Iam an ml learner and I run many powerfull programme on it, Just think what I mean by powerfull programme. The programme works for 2 hrs but the computer still remains perfect. I run about 5 virtual machines and I even run them at a single shot. But I use them only for half an hour because it may cause an heating issue for the computer. Overall heartily accept this computer. Buy this computer if you are looking to play games and other works. Here what I mean by ""games"" is that you can play GTA 5 perfectly but you can only play for an 45 min of time because the battery drains quickly and the cpu with gpu gets heated up quickly. Believe me I Olay GTA 5 on it. Don't believe on false statements that the people wrote. Thanks"

They told me to get back to Amazon and apparently IF YOU BUT THIS LAPTOP THROUGH AMAZON ( OFFCIALCHANNEL PARTNERS OF XIAOMI FOR THIS PRODUCT ) YOU ARE DENIED AND DISCRMINATED AS YOU CANT BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. IN CASE YOU BUY IT DIRECLTY FROM THE MI WEBSTORE, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO BUY THE EXTENED WARRANTY. I have treid and written / tweeted to amazon and MI, and both of them have left me high and dry. DONT BUY THIS LAPTOP FROM AMAZON..BUY IT DIRECTLY FROM MI SITE"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Not for Gaming, Camera quality is really bad, Good for daily office work. Laptop heats up during light gaming,A Processor with heat dissipation of only 15 W trades off Performance with battery, Lower Performance levels on Battery as Compared with AC charging.  The Laptop broke down after only 6 months, Don't Buy. Laptop stopped charging,I went to service center, They said they have to replace the Mother board as that IC us available that it not covered under warranty, that will cost around 44 k.  I thought it is better to buy another laptop from another company,Mi may be good with Phones, But The laptop world is still ruled by the likes of DELL,HP,ACER,ASUS. MI is still a Rookie among these powerhouses.  #Not MI Think before buying."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Its not even 10 days and screen is dead..After spending so much on this pathetic laptop Iam really disappointed. Please don't buy it useless.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"DON'T BUY! Pathetic. Bought it from MI store in Rohini, Delhi. Later came to know that it is Chinese product, with many a app not working. No windows CD or setup, serial number in case something goes wrong. That guy set it with wrong account, did not provide user manual, gave wrong information, serial number not identified by Microsoft find my device. No support from store, if one has to go to service centre just after buying than no use to purchase it. Worst company story ever. Still struggling with setting it up."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Absolute to the point system. No drama. Exactly up to expectations.  I have a MacBook air 2019 also. This mi notebook beats my MacBook air in rebooting and shutdown speed.  From a student's perspective, I simultaneously run VSCode, Android Studio, chrome with 5-6 tabs, and an Android Emulator, and it handles it effortlessly. Fan is turned On and battery drainage starts a bit. But no way on Earth can it ""bother"" any user.  After rigorously using it for more than 1 month, 10/10 will recommend buying!"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Can't upgrade Memory, this killed it for me. Will look for other options. Manufacturers should stop doing this or else we'll be having a lot of e-wastes in the coming years...."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I used this laptop for 1 year , within 3 months screen broken , it havinf cost in show room 15k around , I changed screen at my friend shop , within one year motherboard correpted they said this also under cover warranty and they said I have to paid 28k for this error , with in warranty period , one of the worst product and worse service center ever found , please don't buy , buy standard laptop plz"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"1. Built quality is unparallel, worth the money. 2. I use it for as a work laptop, never gave any trouble. Battery backup i get around 8 hours in normal usage, which is no gaming, only browser surfing and youtube at 50% screen brightness. 3. I faced heating issues, only when gaming high graphics games and when rendering videos. Normal times none. 4. It feels like a biased review writing it, but honestly it game me no trouble, if you are looking for a laptop for your work and need speed, and you are more of a want a built quality which is par of what apple offers, this is the one to go. 5. Lucky me i did not face any issue, i have no idea about the service which Mi offers in India, but the product which i good turned out to be good :D  CONS: 1.No MS Office, only 1 month trial period, Windows 10 is pre installed, which is good and i get regular updates. NOTE: Though the processor is good, don't use it for gaming and damage the motherboard and come here and complain, its an ultrabook yes, but not a gaming laptop."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"it's amazing man i was reluctant to go fot Mi nut seriously the known brands like hp lenovo etc are nothing compared to this i mean yes you may say that it's not that elegant it doesn't flip or convert to something or its cheaper than the others but it's the most updated version in terms of your processors and so budgetary also, battery life is gud it's been a year now i am using it better than hp lenivos and all trust me you buy lappy for 1 lakh and now they disappointed me because i used this 😂 go for it !!! 🥺"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Very bad don't go for it. It's useless. Not working. This is the review after 13 days. I wish I could return it. Please 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,One star only
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"It's a really great laptop with good specs but as nothing is perfect it has some flaws such as no backlit keyboard , no extra slot for ram but to be honest this is the best light weight laptop you can get in this price range. If you want i7 10th gen, mx 350 you would need to shell out more 75k from your pockets but with this option you can get those high performance specs at 60k and you can buy other peripherals such as hardisk and all with the extra money. It's probably best in this price range with a really good build quality,good performance, good battery life and great looks while sacrificing backlit keyboard and some more cons."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Best best and best laptop at this price range you can buy i7 model with out thinking so much,go for it👍👍"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I bought the laptop on the day of the launch and have used it ever since. It is totally worth the price. It is running super smooth and i have been using it for multitasks in work from home scenario. I scanned a lot of laptops before buying this one, and i give thumbs up."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"If you are searching a trusted leptop in budget than MI is best brand. This leptop is really best in budget.  Those guys who want to edit music, play games and want to edit videos for YouTube or for any other purpose, this leptop is best.  the betry I can say good. Bcz it discharge after 3.5 to 4 hours of non-stop working time, obviously if you will do editing and play games which really want High power which obviously consume betry alot.  Otherwise this i5 leptop is best in budget. If I talk about other i5 leptops, they come under 60k or 70k minimum. So uts really good in budget."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,A good laptop with sufficient horsepower for daily chores. Have been working smoothly since last 2 months. Pros: - Mobility (Light weight) - good design - Decent connectiviyoptions  Cons: - Slightly bigger as creen size would have been optimal - Better graphic card - Ram upgrade not possible  Aftersales service is to be seen
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Got MI hoping for a good i7 laptop.  1. Speaker volume is very low 2. Screen size is small 3. keyboard keys are very small to type 4. there is no backlight 5. It seems funny to use this laptop 6. It is so small.. you may easily damage this or step over it.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I decided to go for this, replacing my 2013 Macbook Air but the quality isn't anywhere close. The lock screen freezes several times and the only possible resolution is a hard reboot. Sometimes, the keyboard doesn't respond altogether. The battery life is good but the fan makes a lot of noise if you use it continuously for 3-4 hours"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,No touch screen at this price. No backlit keyboard. NOT Made In India.  Tech specs talk high but lot of issues with customers using it.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Worst product from mi it's better to go with Hp laptop
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I bought it in India, and I've been using it in Poland for work(IT) for an year now. It's fast and good for gaming as well. I went this one, as camera is not built in. It seems like I made the right choice."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"I absolutely loved the laptop. First of all because of its size. It is just the size of an A4 paper. Very easy to carry anywhere I go. I am not a gamer so this is the perfect laptop for me to buy. With i7 10th gen it is also a little future proof. A very good option for people who need laptops for office work, students, people who wish to do light gaming etc."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,No other brands offers a laptop with similar specifications at this price .Iam using it for more than one and half month.battery back up is superb... Sofar no issues
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Good laptop at this price it privide i7 10 gen in such a good price and also a good graphics..graphics are good to play games but not so hood to play bery high graphics game it does not lag but heats up quickly . Only heating problem on high end gaming
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Worst product ever don't buy this trash. I wasted my 60k on this 😩
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Review after 3 Month Using the laptop have very beautiful design and slim the screen bezel is so thin and looks very high class with full metal body the laptop performance so fast with core i 7, battery can run up to 9 hours in normal work the laptop is very silent and no any noise and also no any heat from the laptop am so satisfied with the laptop. if your budget in this price range, just go for this laptop. no other competitor can beat this laptop in this price range and the design look so high class."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Rest all is fine...i have normal use, battery performance etc is good... I don't like inbuilt webcam but it has really really horrible speaker... U can't hear a thing..."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Don't like keyboard. And board. Quality of board is not good must go for metallic
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Waste laptop It has very less clock speed than given in description. Not value for money At that price segment there are many better laptops.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Terrible service Quality. My charger stopped working and it seems they don't sell chargers.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,One thing I regret will be the backlit keyboard. It is a vey basic feature which u don't look for but is a must
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Core i7 10th gen in 60k! Are you kidding me!
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,It's Chinese product with zero reliability. Can last for 5 years and can become garbage within 5 minutes. Buy anything but not Mi
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"The laptop is amazing in regards to the performance in most of the tasks. When it comes to gaming, I would suggest to not even try on this laptop. Gaming on an emulator should be fine though. And no webcam inbuilt webcam is a pro for me, I don't use it much and the included USB webcam is good enough for the situations when you will need a camera."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Absolutely bezel less. Best for moderate gaming and editing. You may face some lag while using heavy softwares like davinci resolve. It's the best laptop for streaming videos and editing. Gaming is not mentioned as U processors are battery efficient but not high performing. You can buy H processor for even more better performance but it costs you more.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"i was using hp notebook from 2015and it used to hang alot so i changed my laptop to this and i purchased this from an offline mi store trust me this laptop is awesome built quality,overall experience reminds me about macbook"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Left speaker stopped working. Don't know why......????! After 1 month of usage rest all is awesome. Why there is word restriction
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,No good laptop because this is not suitable for students and business and also very less function available in this lappy
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,dont waste your money on this laptop better alternatives are avaliable at this price point. build quality is weak please check the reviews in youtube.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,I have bought it 4 months ago performance is very good the only thing i hate is keyboard doesn't have backlight those who work at ni8 it I'll become very tough to work and sound quality is not much good but specifications at that price is super cool
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Not up to the mark
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Don't buy
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Best laptop in the range and worth buy it. Using it from last 6 month and still it is giving best performance.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,The device has blacked out and restarted 7-8 times in the first month of use. In the first week itself it had black scree.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,How ever good it is but u cann increase the ram .So it's useless if u r buying for hardcore purpose
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,The laptop is very fast handy and premium.. But a very major and serious issue is that it heats too much according to me the air vents are not at right place fast and of any use.. Really burns my thigh!! 💥💥
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,👌
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Doesn't hang, fluid and fats. Good quality. Back light should have been more important if added but can't complain any more"
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,made in china
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,One can buy this in low price And then can upgrade the profiles of this every parts it will be a huge combination with it's processor
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,I would have purchased if RAM was either upgradeable or 16 GB. It looks stunning. MI always gives you your money's worth.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Same product received. Nothing for dislike. Excellent service. We always thank to Amazon for service on time. Thanks Thanks Thanks
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,I have used many brands but using such a bad comment . You got a very bad experience with this
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Excellent for daily tasks and engineering students and must buy a vaule for money and display excellent with this price point
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,The 'Best' laptop in this price range.Worth buying it 💯!its slim design makes the laptop sexy. Very much satisfied 💯!
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,The Build quality Xiaomi provides at this price range is 🔥🔥🔥...  The Horizon display gives the laptop a premium look.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Very Good Laptop good for editing and online classes It is Very nice laptop please buy this only because it is very smooth.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,I wish I could get it as a reward from Amazon fun zone as I can't afford it for myself.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"1. Average sound quality. 2. Display is too small and dull. They have to give options for a glossy screen. 3. 60 K value laptop doesn't have a backlit keyboard 4. 8 GB ram doesn't feel compatible with the i7 processor. It lacks sometimes while gaming. 5. A separate camera is a really bad idea. By just increasing 5 mm bezel size they can easily fit the camera. 6. It feels like built from plastic, not metal. 7. No warranty extended option if purchase from amazon. 8. You can only replace, can't return it, bad policy. i7 processor and longer battery life aren't enough for 60 K value laptop. In my opinion, pls don't purchase it."
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"THE FIRST THING U NEED TO KNOW BEFORE BUYING IS--THE LAPTOP DOESNOT PROVIDE MICROSOFT OFFUCE365 APPS.(LIKE microsoft Powerpoint,Word,Excel......)BUT U CAN U THEM ONLINE IN GOOGLE FOR FREE OR CAN BUY BY SPENDING MONEY OR JUST SEE SOME OTHER APPS LIKE GOOGLE DOCS OR WPS... . Value for monet---10/10 Build Quality - Great Display -- ----VeryGood Speed ---------Very Good -- i5 processor and NVdia Graphic card(MX350) Trackpad ------ BAD--- as it feel to be not fit properly(But good at touch response) Keyboard----Good but no backlit."

Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Classic one.
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,Good laptop
Notebook-Horizon-i7-10510U-Graphics-XMA1904-AF,laptop,"Laptop is good in mid range. It has got metal body and build quality is superb. It gives a premium touch when you hold it in your hand.  It looks good. Laptop is very useful for day to day productivity work. Browsing, word, excel and other day to day work can be done seamlessly. Moderate coding softwares would run seamlessly.  Unfortunately best things ends here. There are no other things that will impress anyone beyond expectations like Mi mobile does.  Even if you buy highest variant i7, the processor is weak as compared to other affordable gaming laptop. Please check processor variant on intel site, their clock speed. Don’t get fooled with unlocked clock speed because even if you manage to achieve turbo or max clock speed it will deteriorate processor life span due to lack of cooling system.  The gpu processor by no means can be used for gaming also professional video editing would be tough.  Memory can not be upgraded which is big let down. 8gb ram is enough in most cases but after some time you would want to upgrade ram but laptop doesn’t support for ram upgrade.  Overall moderate specs with beautiful package. Nothing extraordinary like other Mi products."
Dell-i3-1115G4-Integrated-Graphics-D552175WIN9BE,laptop,The worst product.. It takes years to start.. I bought it 10 days ago.. And am using it for the 3rd time.. It does not open.. I feel like crying.. Never buy it..
Dell-i3-1115G4-Integrated-Graphics-D552175WIN9BE,laptop,"Worst ever laptop. Too many Dell add-one. Takes an hour to boot. On top of that, heats up, pathetic performance. And Microsoft - wish I could send you to oblivion. With each update, it gets worse. Don’t buy."

Dell-i3-1115G4-Integrated-Graphics-D552175WIN9BE,laptop,"Dell of course was the first choice as the brand, but it's too slow... The laptop is not even 30% occupied of its storage capacity and the only working going on currently is of media player yet it takes forever to turn on or even showing screen saver after I log off! The page automatically goes up these days IDK what the issue but I feel I have overloaded it and it's creating issue with its performance, my sister's laptop is half the capacity in RAM and Hard disk but twice as fast.. I feel it's just the brand name nothing more! On many websites it's mentioned as keyboard is back-lit, but disappointed to see its missing and dell's own site says it's optional."

Dell-i3-1115G4-Integrated-Graphics-D552175WIN9BE,laptop,"A pretty decent buy. Using it for over 2 months now.  1. The Full HD anti-glare display (personal preference with inbuilt Windows 10 Night Light feature on) gives a warm and better viewing experience with no stress on eyes. 2. Build and make is a lightweight plastic body but the quality of plastic used + good color, narrow border bezels makes it look more premium and its pretty lightweight which makes this laptop ""on the go"" compared to many laptops in this price bracket. 3. Comes with a SSD which helps superfast boot up in seconds. Don't go for this if you are planning to store lot of data in your drive. 4. i3 Processor coupled with 8 gigs of RAM makes multitasking better. 5. Great audio quality  All in all, this feels like good laptop for working professionals or students with someone with light usage."
Dell-i3-1115G4-Integrated-Graphics-D552175WIN9BE,laptop,"Slow and some applications stops abruptly. Surely not for gaming but even for kids for online classes and basic stuff not the best option. Upgraded from Lenovo, which was causing similar issue but feeling the same thing."
Dell-i3-1115G4-Integrated-Graphics-D552175WIN9BE,laptop,"One of the most third class laptop in the whole universe, there keypad are worse, there touchpad and hopeless Display is also worse"

Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,So far we are very happy. Using it for Online classes. We ordered one more. The backlit keyboard is the highlight.
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,"Laptop quality, design, screen quality is too good. Battery backup is also good.Backlit keyboard is attractive and the touchpad is just outstanding.Touchpad works so smoothly."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,1. USB port only two placed side by side. You can not connect modem and usb mouse at a time due to lack of space between two usb porta. 2. Memory could have been greater than 256 GB. Others are ok
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,"I got this on 16th aug and waiting some time for giving review. It is a great experience with Amazon amd dell thanks them for the beautiful product. And also a beautiful delivery. Only problem is battery backup is very less, i am getting 3 to 3.5 hours backup with normal use."
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,Very bad quality
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,"Good looking, operations are fast, display is good"
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,It's good
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,"I have purchased this laptop last week from local seller for rs 44500/- it's very good ,battery back up is 4.5 hours, it comes with McAfee antivirus licenced for 1.5 years and ms office 2019 with life time validity. It's light weight and thin mint colour is nice , I'm using it in my csc centre , it's performance is very good , due to ssd it's fast. And it's keyboard is back lighted Overall it's a very good laptop from Dell.and i got a original Dell laptop bag also ."
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,I bought this product on 21/06/2021....Worst product ...worst battery backup..Poor charging process...As I remove charger anytime it goes switchoff....Don't buy this product......Total waste of money ....
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,Extremely good for official and online class purposes. It's a quick processing system. Due to SSD performance. Best to purchase this model for us.
Dell-Inspiron-3501-Integrated-D560444WIN9S,laptop,"Laptop is excellent, however i would recommend adding a additional 4GB Ram stick if you can. And this laptop is not more gaming as temperature reaches above 80 degree celsius after 5 minute of gaming, however that can be managed if you disable intel turbo boost....then temperature won't exceed 75 degree, however fps may be decreased. But this can be ignored as this laptop doesn't claim itself to be a gaming laptop."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Brilliant product  Most of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDD  My base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make sense  Second requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GB  Third requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this case  Fourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.  The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.  The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.  I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place adjacent to additional monitor  Very satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.  Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier. I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.  I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C type  This is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy"
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,First got the product delivered couple of days late. It worked fine for 1 week and then all of a sudden screen is gone ! Poor response from HP service centre ... they are saying screen must be physically damaged which is not the case at all and there after no update from last 3 days after constant follow ups ! So I cant use laptop anymore just 1 week after buying it! Poor Quality and worst service By Hp support !!!!!!!
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"I've been using it for 3-4 days now. Experience wise it's great. It gets your work done. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on its gaming performance. Pros: 8GB RAM helps windows 10 experience a lot. Light Weight. I don't consume storage space on my laptop so 256GB SSD is more than enough. Boots in less than 10 seconds Windows 10 & Office Student lifetime Subscription is a huge plus too Cons: The looks are pathetic. The display is very very very BAD Plastic Body, Heck Plastic Trackpad feels very cheap.  If you are able to make compromises on the cons then It's an average buy. Okay to use for work & study. Gets things done. I think it's the only 8GB product under 40K. Let's see .. I will update this review in a few months if the product still exists till then."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Very good product in these range , under 40,000-i get it in 38,000 something It saya 7hours battery life but it is near about 5hours , it's very good 👍. It take near 2 hours to charge fully. It has ssd , it starts in seconds. Good for light gaming 🎮 , light - average video editing. It take another hard drive for storage, after sometime. It's good in these price range, go for it. 👍😎 It has 1 year warranty and you extend it by buying the extented warranty package for 14 15 series hp laptop."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,My one week usage experience: Boot time:10-15 Seconds Response time for a folder & apps opening:1-2 sec Hardware wise Keyboard -Excellent ergonamically for constant usage Display- Color gamut and the resolution will be flawless Trackpad- Average but for long usage one should rely on External mouse Speaker: Does the job perfectly for a laptop both in call quality and infotainment Charger: 65w adapter will charge 0-100 in 2 hours time Battery Backup: with 100% Cpu usage can expect 4-5 hours anything with 50%-80% Cpu usage can expect 6-7 hours as mentioned in description  Comclusion: For office / commercial user who require emails and Ms office online classes & infotainment mutitasking of 4 at a time can close your eyes to buy
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  It’s been 1 week only n laptop stuck on bios update loop.i m not able to see window screen. Bios update is never ending. I don’t know it’s laptop problem or sellers problem. This is my second laptop from same seller.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Worst product. Within one week boot volume crashed and one year HP support is awesome, I raised a complaint and after two weeks they said to contact nearest HP support center directly. It's been around one month I keep pushing the HP people but no one rectified my issue. It's not 'HP customer care' it's 'HP Customer DON'T care'."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Web Camera quality is average, ok for light conference calls. Speed is decent and best part is the original and activated Windows 10 and MS Office 2019 Home & Student software. It is perfect for home use. Some people have posted that it is not FHD panel, rather HD (1366x768). But for Student or for parents it is perfectly fine  Note: Product Delivery experience was the worst ever. Be prepared to have delay in delivery for absolutely no reason at all."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Very light and thin. Best one within 40k.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..  Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )  Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )  Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)  Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)  Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use. You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)  Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.  So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It! Overall rating 9/10.  (you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)  Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.  - vivek 😊"
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Before buying this product please make sure you this. We have decided to buy this product the first ever problem was it was enabled to connect with router and second thing it get's hang frequently which only brought before a month. We have consulted the hp services they are were will be responsible of ntg as you brought it from Amazon. If we consult this Amazon these people are asking us to contact hp people. 35,000 matters it not 10 for our middle class people. Even if like have any exchange these would allow choose any options. Please before buying any electronic goods make sure that the company and also refund policy are good otherwise there would be lot of problems to be faced just like did"
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Good and affordable system from HP. The system come with loaded windows 10 and MS office. Slim and light weight the important things at low prices is the RAM which is 8 GB with i3 processor make the performance excellent. The battery back is more than 5 hours which is also food
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"This is the worst product ever. DO NOT BUY.  I bought this laptop in Sep 2020 and the laptop stopped working within one month. Amazon is refusing to take return and replace this product.  For the past 2 months I’m trying to get the laptop fixed through HP service. Most pathetic service. They close the tickets immediately without resolving the issue. Despite repeated requests, they are not sending technician to fix the issue.  Getting no warranty support or technical support."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Its just around 10 days since we bought the laptop. Today as we were working it showed ""HDD 3FO Error"" on bootup. On BIOS tool it says storage volume is not present!!! Have raised an issue with HP for technician visit. Hope they could solve it!!! Not sure it is an one off problem or general issue with this model."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"# 8gb Ram, 256gb nvme SSD at a decent price point is a great deal.. # laptop is pretty thin and light, good for carrying around and regular usage. # Has good processing speed due to nvme ssd n 8gb Ram installed in it.. # Lag free windows 10 experience # Comes bundled with student/home ms office, just need to activate it. # Looks and build quality are moderated but decent enough for the given price point. # Display quality as mentioned by some of the buyers isn't that bad either, i could hardly notice any problems in it.. # Has got a good sound quality."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Pros: The product is amazing as it has 8gb Nvme ram and 256gb SSD storage It boots up within seconds and is very fast, It comes with pre installed MS Office and Student editon which is a boon for students. Cons: Not so good webcam And marks on the laptop when we touch it but it is manageable at such a good price range of approx 39k INR OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THIS LAPTOP."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Purchased this as replacement for my aged HP ProBook 440G1. Replaced an i7 with this i3 option for these reasons: Latest technology -11 Gen, 2021 model, SSD, 8GB RAM. Did not want to spend a lot as I have a Surface Pro. Got 12k in exchange for the 440G1. So this fit all the bills. First impression of product is good. Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around. Easy to activate both windows and MS Office with instructions given on product page in Amazon. Overall, a decent product that won't dent a hole in your pocket. Would have given 4 star had the body been metallic and sturdier."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"This isn't review after 3 days of Use. Pros: Very thin and light. Easy to carry Battery backup is good 5-6hrs Boots up in less than 10secs and b shutdown in less than 3secs 8gb ram+256ssd makes the laptop super smooth and fast. Sound output is good. Cons: Camera is average. Not Very great. No backlit keyboard. Track pad could have been more smooth but a mouse will do the work.  Overall: Great Laptop for 35000 price range. Best for students, office use, etc. Rating 8.5/10"
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Worth the investment. Got this with an exchange offer and got it for 30k. Great for business and home use. Not recommended for games or heavy duty data processing works.  1. Light weight 2. Quick bootup thanks to SSD. 3. Mat finish, keyboard quality is great 4. MS office 2019 comes free 5. Audio quality is above average 6. Video streaming and display is quite good 7. RAM can be upgradable up to 16gb but may have to let go 4k *2 rams DIIMs 8. Hard drive cannot be expandable, need to replace."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,The product which we received was really bad. Problem was faced with WiFi connectivity. Initially it get connected with WiFi and then automatically get disconnected.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Boot time is long.I have another lenovo of same specifications but that starts in 5 seconds. Outer finish is like cheap plastic. Looks like a cheap under 20K product. Disappointed to know that there is no return option only replacement possible. Will never buy any costly products from Amazon. Better to visit shop, see the product and buy."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Very good laptop but screen not satisfied in down right side screen frikering when I move the screen so...
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Writing this review after 1 month of usage. Purchased for 36k and here are few observations: (I am not a tech guy, but who use laptop for regular day to day usage) - Installation can be done by self and not required to avail the Amazon service at additional cost. - Ideal for School/college students/ regular users with not much of technical work to do. - Not ideal for Gaming purposes. - Decent booting speed & No hanging issues encountered so far - Video streaming apps load decently, the streaming quality is Okayish. - No keypad light available."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Before you go for this product, also keep in mind that how much money you spend on this laptop. After exchange, I got it at 32k. At this price, it's more than I expected. Intel i3 processor is enough for my needs. I even run VMs with 2 core. I don't want to launch 3-4 VMs so that's reasonable for me. SSD and 8GB is very quick and smooth operations. Genuine Windows and Office is a plus. One less thing to worry about. Last, Amazon is very good that it got delivered same day..."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Within a month of purchasing this product, the trackpad started heating up (attached is a video). When contacted the HP customer service team, they were so casual about this, saying - ""you are lucky that the battery was not affected otherwise it would have melted and caught on fire"". When asked how did this even happen with a brand new laptop, we were informed - ""electronic hai kuch bhi kabhi bhi ho sakta hai""  And the best part is that HP's warranty does not cover burns and battery melts. Lack of safety for consumers, and accountability of a low-quality product sums up our experience of the HP brand."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Amazing speed, at first I had issues with start menu response but later fixed by update. Only laptop in the range with 8Gb ram. Keyboard is perfect as the button's stiffness is well manged. Very light and almost negligible bezels. Only problem is the display which is HD and not FHD, although resolution doesn't make much difference but the inaccurate colour reproduntion and lack of Antiglare coting makes it an average display. Battery life is 6hrs + once full, charging is fine alomost 2 hrs. Overall I cant find a better laptop in this range."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"After 1 month of use, 1. display is blinking 2. and bios boot issue appeared. 3. Power button doesn't work some times... You need to hold for seconds 4. Only advantage of this laptop is thin and fast boot due to ssd. 5. Least quality Graphics  6. My final advice is... Go for different models.. This is built with least quality material. And motherboard doesn't support even small applications... Dell inspiron models are seems best as I used it earlier."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"After going around shopping at shops for a 8 GB Ram +SSD +i3 11 gen specs I met very high quotes and low spec config models from various popular brands.Finally this purchase met all my expectations and fit my tight 40k budget.Windows+office was a bonus, highly recommend."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Bought this laptop during about 3 weeks ago during the Navratri sale offer. Delivery was quite prompt, got it properly packaged the very next day.  Usage wise quite satisfied. Battery backup is also good.  Regarding display, am satisfied for regular googling / reading, even watching a movie is decent. Screen was not very clear during a Zoom call.  So overall am quite happy with this laptop for regular use."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Its been a week , so far so good. Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k. Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) ."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Review is for the 10th gen i3 - 2 core model laptop Pros Compact size / weight to carry around. Windows 10 Home for life time. Office 10 (I guess that is only Word, PowerPoint and Excel) but for single user . Has Ethernet LAN connectivity (newer models do not have this). 8 GB RAM (contrary to the 4 GB mentioned on HP site for this model) which will give good performance . 256 GB SSD storage, improves speed and handles shocks.  Cons A little reflective screen. No DVD drive. Both the legacy USB Connectors as well as Power Supply connector are on Right hand side while 1 USB . Type C USB connector is on left hand side. Wifi speeds are only upto 150 Mbps, though YouTube streaming experience was good without any lag."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"In less than a month, the laptop failed while in operation. The SSD hdd is not accessible although the diagnostics indicate the disk is fine. From the reviews, it appears the laptop model has inherent problem & hence should be called back by hp and replaced with functional/tested models. Other features like light weight & thickness are overridden due to these failures leading to data loss."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"The laptop is really nice for its price, but the screen is pretty reflective just like mobile screens. THERE IS NO antireflective/ antiglare coating on the screen as mentioned here on amazon. Now if a reflective screen is not an issue with you go for it. As for me its very problematic as i usually work in well lit room, and i will have to get used to it and sit on places away from windows and bulbs on the back and sides."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Look no further if your budget is 36K, close your eyes and buy it. 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and I3 10th Gen with MS OFFICE-License configuration you won't get it anywhere else. It boots in just 5 Sec with super fast performance. Initial Setup is very easy and you can do it yourself. Also if you follow Video uploaded by seller, registering MS OFFICE License is also easy. Display and Camera is ok (not best). Speakers are loud and clear. Overall a great buy."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"It is better product for those who have the budget under 40000, its processing Power excellent. Startup 10to15 seconds. 8k videos are run comfortably. Battery backup upto 4-5hours. Mice good. Speakers excellent. Overall performance good. I suggest it for the students who require laptop. Only the problem is that there are only two USB ports , should have been three."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Got it in a good price with exchange. Coming to the features it's a 2021 model with 11th gen i3, suitable for most day to day tasks. I use it mostly for logging to remote work machine. Can use it for light to medium level programming. Camera quality is fine for zoom calls. Speaker looses clarity at full volume. Battery gives around 2-2.5 hrs average backup when I used for video calls and its self discharging if laptop is not used for long. Keyboard and trackpad are the worst, always use a external mouse and keyboard combo. It has 2 USB 3.0, 1 hdmi, 1 USB type C, 3.5 mm ports. So need to judiciously use them or buy an external USB adapter. Overall good buy if you get a great deal on the price."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Battery excellent
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Bought for my son, he didn't want it, I landed up using it. Exceeded expectation considering it is only a core i3. The included Windows 10 boots fast in about 10 to 12 secs. Standard application like Microsoft Words, excel, chrome, edge etc runs without any lag. installed MX Linux as a dual boot and it runs very very fast without any issue, in fact it boots to desktop in about 6 to 7 secs. The laptop is well suited for normal computing needs. Gaming haven't tried. At 34k price point it is a value for money product. Recommended."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Mine is a I3 11th Gen 256GB SSD Version. Boots up within 6 seconds. Has a great full HD screen so working on documents and reading texts is a breeze. But it is a shiny screen so not an antiglare. Comes with a lifetime version of office so you are covered there. You just need to activate it Camera is good for a laptop considering it is used for video conferencing only and not for clicking selfies or landscapes. Handles multiple tabs in browsers and HD videos smoothly. Wifi connectivity is good, catches signal 2 rooms away. Speakers are loud and clear and upward facing so you wouldn't need external ones for video calls. Battery life is great too. Gets 4 hours with streaming. 2 USB ports are placed next to each other so connecting 2 thick USB drives simultaneously may not be possible. Also got a USB C port for those new age connectors. Laptop body has a textured surface so maintenance is easy. It is very light so handling is easy. But the keyboard and touchpad could have been better. Keypad feels bit flimsy and childish, touchpad has a wiggle room and not as tight it should be. Hinge is wider and stretches from end to end so should last longer than those old models with 2 split ones that used to break easily. Looks like HP was able to save costs only by compromising on the build as you don't find another laptop with this config in this price. I only hope that the keypad and the hinge last as long as the laptop as I don't see any other weak points in this laptop. If your usage is limited to your kids online classes, browsing and MS office, just close your eyes and buy this."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,It's a pathetic product. Very bad build quality looks fragile. Never expected such kind of product from HP that is too through Amazon. The quality is highly detoriated and.when I am asking for the return through refund Amazon Customer Care people are giving absurd policy reference. I am contemplating on approaching the Consumer Court for the redressal of the issue.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Overall experience is good as expected. Performance is mind blowing I just bought this laptop for coding and personal works. This is only products with 10gen ssd and 8 gb ram within 40k range. I am using HP laptop for 8 years that's why I chose HP laptop only. Those who are looking for laptop for study and personal purposes can consider this product.  Booting speed: 4.5/5 Camera: 4/5 display: 3.5/5 lightweight: 5/5 charging: 5/5 battery backup: 4.5/5 overall: 4.5/5
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Speed is fast. Very quick boot time. Build is average. But performance was very good after initial 3-4 days of usage.  Need to have Microsoft account in order to activate the laptop first time. Also it's required to activate the MS office product which comes pre installed with laptop.  If you have opted for old laptop in exchange then delivery might get delayed as in my case they could not arrange and it got delayed by 2 days.  But overall experience with laptop is good. Battery back up satisfactory. At least for 4-5 hours. Camera quality is average. Sound is good. Since it's ssd, much faster than traditional hdd."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,If you can overlook the build quality the rest of the laptop is absolutely stunning. It is a complete value for money I tested rendering a 4K video of a 20 minute clip and it was able to render it just 7 minutes. Aa it few 50gb raw files and Photoshop was able to handle it just fine. Eleventh generation chip has 3.8 GB graphics that is sufficient for day 2 day work and edit. The trackpad is flimsy but strangely very accurate and gets the job done.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"I have been using this device for almost 3 months. For the price there aren't many laptops under 40K with offer 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and Office as well. This laptop has some good compromises for the price. No backlight keyboard but a good, comfortable keyboard. No FHD display but a decent battery life. The SSD speeds are pretty fast as well. So a fast boot up. Speakers are also decent. Overall, I use it everyday for work and no problems till now."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,This is an amazing product for liye coders. Who are noob in coding they can try this lappy.  SSD- because of ssd the timing of loading am operation and opening the os is little faster.  RAM 8GB- 8 GB ram is enough for specific coders. It is good for multitasking. But don't try this if you are a heavy gamer or heavy coder.  KEYBOARD- keyboard is greally good. Easy for typing but there is no numpad.  TOUCHPAD- a fine and smooth touchpad with mat finish which is appreciatable.  Screen- Full hd and 14 inch. You may find it a little small but still it is very much clear.  OS - windows 10 is preloaded in SSD. Therefore the machine is faster than others.  MS OFFICE- ms office is also preloaded. You need not to buy or download it.  HARD DISK- 1 TB hard disk is there.  LAN PORT- LAN port is given.  USB PORT- only 2 USB port at your right side.  SD CARD PORT- available at left side.  CHARGING POINT- at your right side.  HEADPHONE POINT- at your right side.  CAMERA- camera is quiet okay for normal video calling.  KEYLIGHT- Keyboard light is not available.  Battery- you can use it up to 6 hrs.  All over you can buy this if you are a lite coder. But not recommended to heavy gamer or coder.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,I bought this laptop for my kids for online classes. But seems I can also do my office work using it. You cannot get better than this under 35k with good brand name. Pros: 1. Thin & Very light weight 2. Very fast processing and no heating 3. Build is good in this price range Cons: 1. No anti-glare screen

HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"I wanted to use it for freelance Writing purpose. And it's working fine. Laptop boots within 7 seconds because of SSD.  I use many tabs at a time, 6-7 at least and it's giving fine performance. There's no slag in the system.  Screen is fine too. Even in brightness, it works fine. Antiglare lets you stare at it for as long as you can work. No strain on eyes.  Audio is superb. It's better than I thought. Realtek audio gives a solid sound and home theater like feeling.  Value for money.  Recommended for people using it for freelance writing work, office work or students."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,The laptop screen is having a yellowish tint whenever there is a white background which is a strain on eyes. It’s been one week and the HP service personnel has not come to check despite calls everyday. Through service Center came to know that warranty period started one month before buying. Rectification still not done. Speaker quality is very average.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,I m writing this review after using for about nearly two months . So i bought hp i3 8th gen 8g 256gb ssd model . Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it . Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor. This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like: - Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem. -While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come. -Also keyboard also it good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard . -while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .  These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that. Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now. Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only. Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough. FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money. Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying. U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Bought this HP laptop last year in Oct'2020. Twice it crashed completely & we lost the data. Than the company replaced the SSD drive mentioning some issue with the same some wherein Jan' 2021.  Ever since than the laptop is unbelievably slow. My 6 year old laptop works faster than this one.  We placed complaint to HP but no response.  Very poor manufacturing, in all probability these HP laptops are seconds & have manufacturing defects. They are selling them online & washing their hands off.  Not advisable. As a matter of fact we will never buy any HP products in future."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,What the hell this laptop is Worst laptop Never ever dream to buy this waste It automatically starts burning when charger was pluged in and got fully burnt Got dead within one month of purchase No support from hp
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Super value for money. At around 40k, it has all the features for a neat laptop. Boot is super fast due to the SSD. The HD space could have been more, but 250 is ok. Screen is amazing and liked the resolution' pictures are crystal clear, Camera is ok; sound is good enuf  Only improvement area could be the track pad buttons; since it is within the pad and not outside, looks lil flimsy ... hopefully it not wear out  On the whole, a good system for day to day use ..."
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Best laptop with great specifications: 8 GB RAM/256GB SSD. Battery life: More than 6 hours make it more valuable Sound Quailty is amazing. No need of extra speaker  Could be more better: Display (view angle not that ,much impressive) Keyboard Quality should improve with metallic finish instead of low quality plastic (On this prize segment, it makes complete sense)"
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,Product description does not mention anything about screen resolution. If you blindly expect a Full HD screen you will end up having a a semi HD screen.
HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Fully satisfied. I have used it for 20 days now. Everyday 8 hours of virtual meeting and sessions on ""zoom"" and ""meet"" and apart from these 8 hours some extra work is being done regularly. But no issue witnessed. Pros - Good camera, Good speed, Good screen quality, No heating issue if you use it properly, Very less strain on eyes, Ms Office, Window 10. Con - Battery backup is less. I am very happy to buy this, thank you Amazon and Hp."

HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"Writing this review after using the laptop for a week. The review is for ""HP 14 (2021) Thin & Light 11th Gen Core i3 Laptop, 8 GB RAM, 256GB SSD"" version.  Pros: 1) Display quality - Sharp images 2) Fast boot as it has SSD 3) Light Weight 4) Loaded with Windows 10 Home and MS Office 5) i3 11th Gen Proc and 8 GB RAM. (Could have been loaded with single DIMM 8 GB instead of 2 X 4 GB)  Cons: 1) Build quality - Cheep plastic, 2) Keyboard and keypad (Does not feel comfortable typing, touchpad gets clicked when typing) 3) Camera quality looks good on Teams app, but when you use it with the default Camera app, it is grainy. 4) Batter is only 3 Cell and can get upto 4 Hours max with only Teams calls. Though the description says upto 12 hours.  Overall, Performance wise a good laptop, could have been better if a higher capacity batter and better quality Plastic / metal used for the Keyboard / built."

HP-14-inch-Laptop-i3-1005G1-14s-cf3074TU,laptop,"I wanted a laptop which don't lag after some use. I found this met my expectations. It's good for this price range as i3. Only issue is, that time hp or dell not making made in india laptops. But now dell start making made in india laptops what you can buy directly from dell official site or amazon. They are best in rates as well as performance."

Boot time is excellent owing to 256GB SSD. Glare does exist but, well you are getting this at about 35k, so some faults do exist. Also camera quality is poor, but again I actually never felt the need to use it frequently. Also if you ask about gaming, then I just had tested Prototype 2, and it did work fine enough even at high settings. The fact that you get lifetime access of Microsoft Office and Student 19, is a huge plus point."

After finding the 1st order defective, since there was no return, I ordered a replacement. I expected same issues in this laptop too. But I was wrong. The replacement is working perfectly fine. The touch is very smooth, screen has good resolution, mouse pad is working perfectly and there is no lag in the transition.  It was just my bad luck that I received a defective piece in the 1st go.  It is a good option to buy in 2-in-1 category at this price."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Build quality is good as well as the performance. Audio is great . Display is good.. its more than enough bright for daily use. Stylus works like a charm. Only the webcam is average.... Just like any other laptop in this range. So far I am happy. Go for it if u r looking for a 2 in 1. I have noticed IPS glow on side... Its not much but it's present. Glass trackpad is present... Its great.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Disappointing laptop. Has started hanging- it’s been 3 times in less than 2 weeks of purchase. And no heavy duty usage at all. Camera quality not good- images appear yellowish. Audio quality is average.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Its the latest model laptop suitable for professional use. It also looks good and very flexible.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Reviewing after 3days of use: (I'm a freelance software developer and a startup founder- using this lap for development and customer support prospects)  The device feels good to my hands. This is my first DELL Product. (Previous was HP ENVY Used almost 8 Years and exchanged it with this). Fingerprints were at a minimum. Unlike some other laptop surfaces, no one will ever confuse this device with a fingerprint magnet. Build quality is solid. The laptop has a 720P webcam with a privacy toggle built-in but the camera quality is not that good this is the only major downside of this lap. The display acts as a stand and provides a lift to the device so that airflow can help cool the machine. It also provides a bit of an ergonomic arch to the keyboard. The keyboard is responsive and snappy. The trackpad is large. The screen showed some light bleed on purely dark screens, but nothing too noticeable. All in all, I thought the IPS display looked sharp. The colors looked good. I never had any problems with viewing angles. Ryzen 5 5500U processor combined with the internal NVME SSD hard drive makes for a fast machine. The PC boots in a matter of seconds. This is not the lightest laptop / 2-in-1 out there. It is not the smallest, either, but I found it hit the sweet spot in terms of size and portability. Now, I like that the monitor doubles as a riser to help provide airflow when the laptop is on a desk, but on my lap, it gets a bit uncomfortable having the monitor dig into my legs. And The computer comes with a minimal amount of bloatware or pre-installed software, The laptop comes with a 15-Month McAfee and MSOffice 2019. Personally, I don't like McAfee so uninstalled it. I will just use Windows Defender. I really like this machine. It is a solid workhorse. The performance of the Ryzen 5500U processor and the battery life really impressed me. I love how it looks. I love the display. I love the keyboard and the touchpad. It is a very solid laptop 2-in-1 computer. (but I'm not using it as TAB mode)"
HP-250-G8-Notebook-3D4T7PA,laptop,"Avarage product Pros: Faster startup Slim Quick charge Cons: Poor finishing product. Visually feels like a old one. Camera quality vey vey poor max 0.9 mp There is no indication when start Screen quality avarage Not many ports As mentioned it is a business laptop, but feels very cheap. I ordered from appario retail, however received from some other seller. Very surprising by amazon. If i have known it possibly not ordered at all  Used for 3 days. For normal use like email, classroom, it works fine.  Slight noise of processor noticed. Turbo boost not effective. Well its a avarage quality product"
HP-250-G8-Notebook-3D4T7PA,laptop,Very Good Notebook PC with decent performance. Best for all purpose home/office use. Comes preinstalled with Win 10 & Office 2019 .
HP-250-G8-Notebook-3D4T7PA,laptop,Overall good experience.
HP-250-G8-Notebook-3D4T7PA,laptop,It met my expectations.
HP-250-G8-Notebook-3D4T7PA,laptop,Good budget laptops. Very well performed. Must buy
HP-250-G8-Notebook-3D4T7PA,laptop,Not satisfied with products
HP-250-G8-Notebook-3D4T7PA,laptop,Nice Product worth for money
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Agreed it has got poweful ryzen 5000 series. And ram upgradability. And greater build quality and premium.  But it has got many issues.  First I ordered. Just flexed 360 and used it to write notes already a dent came off. Not sure. If I noticed before. Existing issue.  And can see some issue with power button some time works some times don't. Not sure if this an software issue.  And returned the product.  And got an new one. Which came with so much of screen bleeding. I understand few products in ips display have this issue. But as long we don't disturb the screen it will not enlarge or depends on the intensity.  But when you start taking notes write something we have to use the touch screen. Either way. It will expand. Check if your laptop has an screen bleed issue. Better to get it resolved soon.  And main thing I have brought this touch laptop is to take notes not for touch Interface.  In this case windows doesn't have an better ui like android does.  With an 14 inch screen and 1.5 kg. You'll feel very difficult to handle. And keyboard can easily gets scartched over time.  It is not like an surface pro where we can detach. The display and use like tab.  And cost of touch screen display would be around 10-15k if gets broken. Consider all this before buying.  It should be handled with so much of care.  Since this the beginning of 2 in 1 laptop it takes time to make it more affordable along with build quality.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Pros: Trackpad, smooth and fast, Battery Cons: Display, worst webcam, system eats up a lot of ram around 50%"
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Item didn't switch ON on receipt. Took much struggling to get back paid money. Disappointed from seller, delivery and amazon."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Please buy from a dell store , do not fall for Rs. 1000 2000 cheaper ones . Mine started to stop charging on 6 th day , amazon guys have taken it up for replacement , but still the experience alltogether isn't worth the price + the unconditional warranty thats also missing . Kudos to team amazon though for an apt timely response ."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Excellent build Scrn quality and active pen is nice The fan is running fast even if theres no process running don't know why Also 4 gb of 8 gb ram is used by the system itself Hinges are really good Not suitable for gaming
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Excellent performance
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Pros: Hinge is perfect, battery backup is fine. Pen is pressure sensitive. Cons: screen is somewhat loose at the top beside camera which may be because of the camera lock"
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Beautiful product, works wonders. S pen results in ease of doing work. Fully folding n touch works smoothly."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,You need to get a screen protection to avoid scratches while writting. Given 4 star because of late delivery. At this price was expecting camera quality a little better. No issues in performance of the laptop. Buy only at less than 65k.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Frend camera is not available
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Good and quality experience. The camera quality could be improved. Dell service is commendable
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Dislike Wrong information shared Bad performance of product
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,this laptop beat in the segment the screen quality is very good
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Display issue
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Camera quality. Not Good
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Pathetic camera 0.9 MP and touchpad also hanging frequently, You need to restart every time. Avoid this laptop if you can."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"This review is specifically against the exchange system. I ordered this Inspiron laptop from Amazon primarily for the good exchange offer on my old i3 laptop. The image attached is of the laptop to be exchanged. I read the terms and conditions that clearly stated that the laptop should BOOT and NOT have any issues with Screen. However the delivery person went on to check the entirety of the old laptop including the keyboard, mouse and even shaked it vigorously for issues!!! So far so good. Now they find some small plastic has chipped out of the SD Card reader and rejects the entire laptop. When I said it's not acceptable as such a stringent criteria was not there in the Terms and Conditions he put me across to his Supervisor. I protested stating that being an old laptop used and abused for years it is practically impossible to have it in pristine condition all around. The Terms and Conditions also spoke only about the key things like Battery, Bootable disk and Screen which were all fine in my case. I even suggested that they can deduct small amount for the plastic casing deformity. The Supervisor cooly advised me to pay the FULL BALANCE and keep the old laptop myself. Needless to state I was upset and refused to accept this type of dubious exchange scheme's and asked them to take back the new laptop.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE AND ARBITRARY EXCHANGE SCHEME"
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"Best in the price range, combines power, touch and utility in single package. Screen is very good, getting 10hrs of battery life, touch is very sensitive and active pen is icing on the cake. A must buy..."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,Good laptop for daily work and programming. Strong built and display. Battery life very good.  Only problem is. Hanging while working in tablet mode
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"For the ones who face the hanging issue, my personal suggestion is to reset it once, it will be absolutely perfect afterwards."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"I contacted dell for a 2-year warranty extension, they asked for Rs 7500 for the basic warranty. I pointed out that dell often sells it for Rs1499, they said it's an offer that does not apply when you purchase the laptop from amazon.  Had to cancel the order."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560470WIN9P,laptop,"So far the product looks very nice and as mentioned in product description all are received in good condition, touch screen is well responsive, screen resolution is FHD and satisfactory. Speaker sound is clear and crystal, am very much satisfied. Overall a very good package product with desent specification and can be used for all purpose. Silver tone colour is so fascinating am loving it. Waiting people can go for it, no wory."

And never believe the product description and also they are not ready to take their laptop back
Acer-Aspire-Generation-Processor-15-6-inch,laptop,"Worst product, the hard disc is not working within 10 days of purchase, service of the Company is poor not responding and attending the problem. Recommended, not to buy the product."

HP-14-inch-i3-1005G1-Natural-14s-er0004TU,laptop,"The laptop is good. Could have been better. This hp 14 gen laptop comes with i3 10th gen processor, 1tb storage, 8gb(1*8) ram and 1gb Intel graphics. The size of display written on the laptop configuration is 14 inch but the actual size is less than 13 inch. It's - 12.5. N height is 9 inches. It came with pre installed office and windows home with lifetime usability. After stating the laptop fir the first time, it asks for email and phone number to complete all the processing and activate the windows. The silver color looks standard and shiny. The keypad keys are lightweight metal alloys, so they are little noisy. Laptop is good. I bought it for 43500, at this price, I had ssd options in hp and hdd options in acer and Asus. Compare to brand value, material, processor, storage and ram, it comes out as one of the best laptop right now. It took around 1 hour and 40 min for me to charge the laptop fully.

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Wrong symbols are displayed while clicking. Details given in photo
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"The product came and although no signs of damage were on the laptop, but it's touch pad wasn't working. We immediately called customer service, but to no avail. Instead of replacing this pathetic laptop which still doesn't work, they insisted us on trying to fix it. Do not purchase anything from this supplier, as they do not even care about calling you back to follow up on any complaint. The laptop looks like a refurbished laptop which is very slow and doesn't work most of the times. If you purchase from this supplier, you will be scammed with a second hand product instead of a new product."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Don't buy this laptop 😡😠
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"it sucks, received it today, it works too slow, gets hang while installing updates. power button keeps on even after shutting it down. bekaar"

Body Plastic quality is bad looks like toy Very slow processer Touch pad not working properly Or not sencing. Camera quality is very poor. Hanging frequently, No RETURN policy. Only replacement"
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"1. Very slow initially. Opening google chrome takes huge time. May be the low processor speed of 1.2GHz is causing this issue, not sure though. Once booting is done and start browsing its all good. 2. Key board is bad, Home and End button os worngly mapped. In the number keys area at right side, we can use these buttons but need to switch off ""num lock"" key. This is highly inconvenient. Arrow keys (Left and right) are named as 'Home' and 'End' but doesn't work. Highly regret on the decision of buying this. Is there any way to return this product ? I would like to return."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"It was not expected by Amazon.  It ordered this product and delivered by the scheduled time but the product has multiple issues.  1. Bad performance: it does not seem that it is Intel i3 Gen10.it is slower than the intel core 2 duo. 2. Battery issue: Battery automatically getting drained. if you fully charge this laptop and you turn on the next day then you will know that battery remains almost 50% only. 3. Automatically powering On: when you open the flip it will automatically turn on without pressing the power button. 4: Amazon Service: When I call Amazon for such an issue then they ensured me that we will definitely help and they guided me to raised a request for inspection of the laptop. Engineer visit after the second request for inspection after calling thrice to Amazon.  5. Engineer inspection report: Technical person inspected and said this issue does exist on most of this model of laptop. So I conveyed the same thing to amazon and demanded a refund amount but they said there is no policy of refund after that they have raised a request for a replacement stating that we will help you at our best if the issue does not resolve even after replacement.  As expected, the issue does not resolve even after replacement and now I am just following up to Amazon but they are not responding."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"I am using Lenovo all in one desktop PC for an year. Based on the performance, i bought Lenovo laptop for my business purpose and my kids online class. Overall the product is good and meet my requirement. However the webcam resolution is not good. Not sure why Lenovo providing lesser resolution webcam which are outdated. Also nowadays ethernet jack option is not available in many brands. Not sure why they discontinue this. We have to buy converter to connect with broadband modem for better speed."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,This I bought after reading the configuration..but it stopped working just 2 days after I purchased....do not buy this at all..
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,It is sooooo slow! Takes ages to open a document or a browser tab. How can a new laptop with nothing cluttering up it's storage be so slow? This laptop was recommended to me at Croma but they didn't have it in stock so I ordered it from Amazon. Going to check if I can return it because using it feels like using a computer from the 90s!
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Nice laptop
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"Looks good.Its a slim laptop with a light weight. Works smoothly ,best for the students those who don't have much heavy work on laptop."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"No issues on pricing. However below are my observations. 1) I checked the fragmentation% was 15%. 😲 for a brand new laptop I would have expected 0% fragmentation. This makes me wonder what did seller do with the laptop? Was the original laptop opened, new softwares installed etc etc. I have sent mail to amazon asking for explanation  2)Also lenovo has enabled unnecessary sevices which take up resources, also adds to boot time. I dont know which to turn off.  No wonder other customers before me complained of slowness, which I also had read. I still went ahead since my usage was very basic and thought a i3 10thgen will suffice.  I am also now joining the chorus and definitely suggest potential customers NOT to buy this model."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"This is the worst product which i have purchased. Even the desktop of 2005 is faster than this. It took morethan 30 min to open Amazon website and write this review about the product. I strongly suggest not to purchase this product and these guys by saying sale, are trying to push such very old products.  Worst experience and dont buy. While writing this review am trying to contact Lenovo support team and they are pushing to different teams to attend service."

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Slowness is the bad for this item..  System need hardly 30:00 minutes to start every time..  I feel very bad about this product.... Intel i3 not good.. While working in office portal at the same need use chrome then again same condition..  Windows key will not respond quickly it's also take more time... Totally don't buy Lenovo product laptop and mobile also...  Thanks!
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"Like - compact and lightweight Dislike - very slow processor, the dual core speed of 3GHz mentioned is misleading. This falls short of even basic online schooling requirements and keeps hanging. Pathetic camera resolution. I have a 2017 HP laptop with much lower specs (i3 6th gen, 2Ghz) which performs far better and is responsive. I would definitely never buy a Lenovo again!"

Also Invoice Not available, they Cheating for government also. Plz plz dont Buy."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Very basic laptop. Don't expect too much Bought primarily for my kids online schooling. 1. The camera is very pixelated. So doesn't serve the purpose of online classes. 2. Very slow processor for the price paid 3. Battery life is not more than 2 hrs at a stretch 4. Set up was a little difficult. Had to take customer support
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"Slim laptop, battery backup good, body colour is ok, camera quality is worst, bit slow even without installing any softwares other than Windows and MS office. MS office & windows has lifetime license. McAfee is trail version for 30days. Mouse pad is left alligned. While just open the screen itself gets on automatically. Display not attractive. Overall not impressive."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,The laptop is not more than 6 months old. Within one year it's CPU IC was gone. So we have repaired from the service center of Lenovo. The Service Center owner was not ready to repair the laptop in the first place as after some request he took the laptop and repaired it. Then also a laptop is getting hung just used by for attending the online classes on zoom.  Lenovo is band and laptop they are providing customer with low quality that is bit concern to me .....  If possible they should replace new laptop to me.....
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,I am sorry to say the product is not good. The return window is closed and I am not able to return the product. The system gets into a different mode with a windows logo and needs to restart the system to get into normal mode. Not sure if Amazon can help me with returning this product and get another product.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"This is worst product and fraud supplier on Amazon.. laptop hang at any time , very slow processing speed , even after all updates many Microsoft apps stops responding suddenly... please don't buy it just because it is less costly or u will regret for 30000 rupees.

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Regretting on buying this cheap and worst product ever from Lenovo and on top of that the customer service is even more worst.. struggling to get the resolution for laptop performance issues
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,i dont know why the peoples rate this laptop as low quality. but my laptop is perfect and best in my budget. the best thing is that it is light weight and slim thats make it more beautiful and different from other laptop. battery backup is awesome 5hrs on you tube easily.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"Not even 3 weeks old & the system keeps freezing / hanging. Extremely disappointing & frustrating. Tried to call customer service.. directed to a WhatsApp number where the customer service experience was extremely poor. All in all, extremely poor / frustrating experience. Would not recommend to any one."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"I have ordered the Lenovo laptop on 22nd October and I received it on 28th October and it was clearly mentioned that you can return upto 7th November, but now I am told that you can replace with the same new laptop, but what would I do with the new one too if it is not upto the mark of my requirements, battery backup is poor and it hardly runs upto 3-4 hours and I being physically challenged not able to charge again and again so frequently as I have to take classes for atleast 5-6 hours, I am left with only one option now to go for consumer forum because it's simply a fraud."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,The product is extremely slow. Have complained to Lenovo online service. Not able to sort. Have asked me to take the machine physically to a Lenovo service centre even though I have an on site three year comprehensive warranty. Poor quality machine. My 10 year old HP laptop performs faster and better given the same parameters. The after sales service is also poor.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"Firstly I can say laptop looks slim and nice but there some performance issue and some heat issues, I have added 8gb additional ram with 2.5 k spending and now the performance is pretty good and no more hanging also heating issue is some what fine now."

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Basically slow....Multiple task can't be performed...But ok... Meets the base requirements...Good for online classes. Battery backup is upto 2-3 hours for online classes...
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Nothing to say about this amazing laptop. It is FHD as in the discription but Hd in the produt name. You can trust and buy this awsome product without any worry. Because it is the best in this budget.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"This might look like a good one at first, but it started shutting down automatically while working, and replaced it through amazon, though the process wasnt friendly at all.

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Hi bought this thinking it's Lenovo so must be good. It's very slow ..you have to wait at least 5 mins after starting. You press any key and it takes 10 seconds to respond. Hangs in between. Display is also not good.. very poor picture quality.. its worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. Amazon should have some internal quality mechanism to check the claim the product makes.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"The worst laptop i have never seen. Its just 7 dyas that i recieved the product. Damn slow , for rebooting it's taking around 2 to 3 mins.

Hope Lenovo and Amazon solve this"
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,Absolute junk being sold by Amazon. The 4GB RAM config is not enough for the hardware and software provided and the laptop just hangs. Lenovo service centres acknowledge this issue and suggest a RAM upgrade to everyone who walks in with this model

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"I'll be real honest with you guys on this laptop. I bought the 14 inch version from a local store in hope of getting better battery life due to lower screen size. Let's come straight to the point, is this laptop worth buying?  Short Answer. NO!!.  But taking into consideration of current lack of choices due to CORONA impact, we can't turn down this deal. I have gone through all the reviews before buying it and after using it this is my opinion.  -Battery life claimed by company is like 5hrs and in my usage I got around 3hrs if not less. -Laptop is not that light weight considering the slim tag it has. But you can easily carry around in your backpack. -Performance wise its good enough but you would have to keep it on performance mode for good performance, but that does comes at a cost of battery backup. -Build quality not great, plastic build feels rather cheap. -Acceptable sound quality -Keyboard usable  Should we go this? -I would highly recommend that you go for the SSD version as it really makes a difference when it comes to day to day performance. Otherwise if its not in stock or its too expensive, go for this one. It would get the job done."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81WE00RCIN,laptop,"Built is ok, but not as good as lenovo used to make earlier. Performance is not thta satisfactory. My 3rd gen i3 lenovo laptop performs better I guess.  Go and install SSD for the windows OS size of current days, will give you an instant"

Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,Laptop gets heated up quickly and also unable to install ms office 2016 licenced version in the same as it is not allowing the installation of ms office which shows microsoft is desperately trying to sell its product microsoft office 365. None of the other apps are not getting installed every app is asking for some price.
Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,Amazing screen quality and well designed keyboard. Recommendable for office users or students. Battery life is good enough. Overall built quality is top notch. Not suitable for gamers at all.
Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,"Good laptop for students, not a gaming laptop. Screen clearity below par.built quality is excellent. Over all excellent for light use  Update: I have been using this latop for over 6 months now. I have a to say it is very good.... If you are looking for a laptop for browsing, emails, study, light work.... this is it 😊"
Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,"Compact, light-weight, good-looking machine packed with Intel brain and that ""Microsofty"" goodness really delivers. ""GO"" for it if you're a student or you do light office work, NOT FOR NERDS & GAMERS!  Laptop Go offers fingerprint reader stitched onto power button, awesome precision trackpad & key travel, impressive speakers providing better-than expected audio experience, magnetic Surface port, and above average battery life.  Microsoft made some cross-cutting by slashing back-lit keyboard, availability of port options (only 1 USB Type A, 1 Type C, and 1 headphones jack) and giving plastic back (which Microsoft is calking ""polycarbonate composite resin system with glass fiber"") casing instead of aluminum.  Its 12.4"" PixelSense touch screen (not that useful for non-360 rotating display) with 3:2 ratio with average, not great, resolution i.e. 1536x1024 (even Surface Go 2 have 1920x1080 display). Camera isn't compatible with 'Windows Hello'. Charger have to be connected with wire running downwards (towards trackpad, as shown in picture of this review) not the other way around otherwise laptop won't pickup its juice for rejuvenation.  The Microsoft badge will definitely make you stand-out in the crowd of 'Macbook', 'HP', 'Dell' in Indian market!"
Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,"It might be good in size and maybe useful for many but what's the use if one cannot type in dim light , there is no keyboard backlight, you would be prompted to buy/ subscribe MS office 365, nothing works until u buy."
Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,The laptop is so small and very light weight.  Pros: 1. Aluminium build 2. Screen quality is good (not the best) 3. No heating issues for day to day tasks. 4. Keyboard. Typing is delightful. 5. Sound output is awesome provided the small form factor  Cons: 1. Missing backlit keyboard (not a big deal for me)
Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,Although it's a new one but it takes time to turn it on. And battery backup is also not good. It was not a good buy for us given the amount that we have paid

Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,This same laptops costs around 55000 rs in US . Instead buy a HP / dell laptop.  Also microsoft service centers are only prominent in metropolitan areas .  Dont buy it . Instead get it from US if you have any of your friends or relatives there.
Microsoft-i5-1035G1-Touchscreen-Graphics-THH-00023,laptop,"Just need an external drive for storage,it is good other than that,the cost must be a bit less,there is a huge price difference here and the U.S"
HP-245-1S5E8PA-ATHLON-3050U-14inch,laptop,Laptop is amazing at price of 22k it also supports nvme. Battery backup is around 3.5 to 4 hours approximately. But there is no laptop caring bag along it.
HP-245-1S5E8PA-ATHLON-3050U-14inch,laptop,Don't buy it. They give false information. It doesn't come with HDD too. BC dimaag khraab kr diya. Hp Customer care ne v ltka diya. Returning soon

Dell-Inspiron-R5-3450U-Graphics-D560431WIN9B,laptop,The MRP of the laptop is 45916. But Amazon have sold in 48007 with 3% discount.
Dell-Inspiron-R5-3450U-Graphics-D560431WIN9B,laptop,"Overall the product is so good and fast. No complain about the product at all. However the price that i paid for the product (delivery was free) is more than the MRP mentioned in the box. I felt its illegal for some sellar to do that. Anyway since its just 100₹ above the MRP I am ignoring this issue.  Also after buying the product I have understood that the MSOffice is trial version, that was a bit disappointing too. However the web version is free and we can use that."
Dell-Inspiron-R5-3450U-Graphics-D560431WIN9B,laptop,"Serves well for kids online classes. MSO license being trial one is the only negative felt. Otherwise rest specs are all decent. If one isn't particular about MSO, go for it."
Dell-Inspiron-R5-3450U-Graphics-D560431WIN9B,laptop,Amazing Laptop. Incredible speed. I can surely make the difference of having ssd vs hdd. Not able to comment on battery backup as I just received today but the battery charging speed is really good. When I received laptop the battery was drained and within 20 mims of charging I had 52% battery.
Dell-Inspiron-R5-3450U-Graphics-D560431WIN9B,laptop,This product worked fine for just a month and then all sorts of problems start. The worst thing is nobody bothers to attend you. It's more than 20 days that this laptop is not working. Please never ever go for this purchase
Dell-Inspiron-R5-3450U-Graphics-D560431WIN9B,laptop,It's pperformance is very good and charge last for long hours. Worth for money

Dell-Inspiron-R5-3450U-Graphics-D560431WIN9B,laptop,Good looking and useful for official work and online classes. Processor speed 3.5 is too much. Best buy in this price
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"Yes the laptop is under 55k which is cheap for a quad core CPU but the biggest problem with this thing is that you won't get the 8 GB RAM as advertised. Since this laptop uses Ryzen 5 3550H, 2 GB of RAM is permanently reserved for the Vega 8 iGPU. Now typically manufacturers allow the user to lower this reserved memory from the BIOS, but not Acer. You are simply stuck with 5.9 GB of RAM unless you upgrade to 16 GB which you have to do from an Acer certified service center to save your warranty. So it's clearly a cheap trick to make more money. If you have the budget, go for the Intel variant of this one or maybe go for the RX 560X variant as that will offer switchable graphics and hence ironically will give you more performance."
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"I received the laptop on the next day of ordering it, that was a major plus point for me. But just before getting this i was about to get the asus tuf fx505DY but when I saw this laptop on amazon i went with this instead. Ill cut right to the chase.  I have been using this laptop for 5 days now and it works perfectly with little to no issues at all. Highly recommend this product to anyone who's budget hits the price of this. If possible go for the ssd version for added performance.  Unlike most of the nitro 5 laptops this one has a good cooling system and doesnt heat up as much as one would expect. I was getting a good 60 to 70 degrees with fans on max speed in gta online and around 55 to 65 degrees on valoarant/csgo with fans at 3/4th the max speed. Since this model has a 60hz display there is little to no point exceeding 60 fps when playing games. On gta 5 I got an easy 80 fps and lowered to 60 occasionally, averaging to 70 fps. As for valorant/csgo it was easy 60fps, but havnt seen the max capability but im very sure its 100fps+. Multitasking is really good with this and heats less. The gtx 1650 card is very good for gaming and is one of the bests u can get for the price.  Now coming to the cons of this product Firstly the most important thing for a gamer is to be able to be updated on any upgrades possible. This laptop features 2 slots for ssd drives and another ram slot for dual channel memory (upgrading ram is very important). As most laptop manufacturers allow for accessing bios to change and tweak your laptop like reducing reserved memory for integrated chip, this laptop doesnt allow for that and with the vega 8 iGPU ur stuck with 5.9gb ram usable and that is not good. You will need to upgrade and thats where the issue comes into place, opening the back cover voids warranty and to upgarde you will need to go to the service centre unless you know tricks or dont want warranty. Its a sad trick they use to extort more money as servces for just adding a ram go for 500 to 800 rupees. Due to this ram issue some games experience terrible fps drop and a bit of lag too. In gta online I experienced a lot of fps drops. Even after boosting ram and optimizing it, the fps drops were persisitent but less. So know this as soon as you buy it you will need to upgrade the ram and shell out around 4000 rupees (estimated) to get 16gb ram (14gb usable) which will help you run games more smooth and even newer games like warzone.  Other than these issues the laptop is really good and smooth but wish acer allowed self upgrades, that is very dissapointing. As for the battery life the laptop fors really well and can last around 4 hours depending on use.  For any queries feel free to message me :)  cheers."
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"The display is 60Hz....1st thing... To start with due to SATA the bootup time is slow...with 2 dual ram, and M.2 dual slots...you can upgrade easily... But here is the catch...The laptop comes with a 2666mhz 8gb but...Rhyzen 3550H supports only 2400mhz ram...no matter how higher frequency ram you buy...it will work only @2400mhz...I upgraded for dual channel ram..and both 2666mhz work max@2400mhz dual channel only......I also added 240gb WD GREEN ssd...now boot up is very fast...and upgraded ram also helps.....The warranty registration from Acer is pathetic...and you can also see some screen bleed on the edges...it is normal as its a IPS panel...Games work fine @medium settings...backup is around 3-4hrs only....So its budget gaming laptop....with medium performance...for better performance you will have to upgrade the ram...and SSD...."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,Best product for gaming as well as coding. Best performance ever.
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"I'm not at all satisfied with the purchase. Look, it's supposed to run almost every game titles smoothly, but it just won't. Every single one of them were stuttering.  However, I purchased this laptop for study purpose. I've tested Mechanical softwares like Solid works 2015, Autodesk AutoCAD 2018, Autodesk Inventor 2018. None of them worked smoothly.  It also has heating issues !!!  I've also tried all the solution from Acer community and YouTube. Even tried resetting it. The issue just won't get solved.  So, I'm calling for a replacement. If it doesn't go well, I'll ask for refund.  NOTE: I did not spend 52K to work solving it's issues.  Also, will update the rating and review once I get a good replacement."
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"Amazing laptop with powerful performance. Battery backup is to better around 6-8 hours. Display quality is much clearer. Full charge in 1.5 hours. Webcam quality is not too good. Sound is perfect. It doesn't heat at high level. Keyboards are smooth with led backlight. Laptop is good at its price range, you should go for it."
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"There is not much pros I can share, apart from decent spec at this price point but there are good laptop from other manufacturer like Asus which gives similar options and the quality of ASUS laptop is far more better.  Cons: 1. Battery backup is worst only getting around 2 hours 2. Apart from top panel rest of the plastic quality is cheap, better go for Asus laptop 3. Hinge keep on dangling 4. Ryzen with Nvidia doesn't work well Linux."
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,Just got it .. Great looks .. good performance and great display. Can't wait to try out games soon. Pretty sure 1650 will give great performance ..
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"I taught this would be a beast in budget. I brought it for 53,000 in a offer recently but this hangs a lot. 8 gb ram which is just nothiat all. And when I type a bit fast keys doesn't work and letters gets skipped in middle. Not at all happy with this and mainly the performance is not at all good. It's always taking longer time to load anything. And automatically it re-starts in middle of ur work."
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,The laptop really looks premium charging the computer from 4% to 100 doesnt even take more tha 1 hour charging speed and backup as per use is good haven't tried any games yet will be trying and updating review still the laptop is giving a good speed and smoothness apart from that narrow bezel really enhances the user interface.
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"This laptop was perfect in the first three months and then BAM! It has been lagging so much! Continuously trying to update its drivers and figure out whats wrong but the most basic of tasks like opening a simple chrome tab takes up a lot time. It is a cheap gaming laptop for sure, but you might want to invest in something better"
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"Really great product but some games don’t run smoothly, gta 5, world war z lags in high settings and as well as low settings. I don’t know if this is just with my laptop. But other games like pubg lite runs really smooth and gives you around 140fps in high settings"

Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,Hi
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,It is a very good product but consider getting a SSD for this laptop
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"First. I have played all the games, in my mind"
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,"Now Using it for more than 6 months. Here's what I experienced do far . This guy is hot. Literally 102*C on gaming mode (with games) and this heat can be reduced till 72*C with maximum fan speed. ( Meaning very good cooling ) Since position of fan inlet is below. It needs to be elivated if you don't want this guy to go hot while you were browsing chrome.  Despite being cheap this thing is a bit strong . ( I guess I'm lucky that it didn't break when it fell accidentally)  No RGB . But red does the work.  Since it's AMD, so don't expect emulator to work good (nox and Nemu emulator gives max fps).  Streaming ? Nah bro. Not good for streaming. AMD will gives your screen freezing issues.  MS office .? Meh! use libre office.  Editing ? 😐 Okay video editing .... It depend upon software and hardware upgrades you do in this device.  Upgrades??? 😆 If you don't care about warrenty and has a bit experience on upgrading laptop components.. Try your combination ( read the limitation)  Keyboard ! Dude I'm literally abusing it's keyboard... 6 months is no joke and I'm actually surprised how durable and responsive it still is.  What more ?? Simulation ? Not good ( not enough memory 5.8 gb is joke) Fl studio : nice 🙂 Photo editing : 5/5 Lag ? For factory settings 1/5 . For modified setting you installed antivirus and services 2/5 For upgraded device (16 gb ram , SSD ) 0.3/5 screen freezing is the only issues  Linux ? Disable safe boot . Enable virutalization . And it runs smooth af ( heating issues , better max fan speed before booting into Linux ) (Chrome os is not supported by amd , so pheonix os won't run smooth here )  And basic things are not included here because they are already good , so not worth writing."
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,I bought this laptop 6 months ago and here are some pros and cons Pros : really good specs acc to price (thats all you really require if you are on a strict budget)  Cons: 1)okayish speaker not loud 2)Overheating and bad airflow is a major problem because it has a bad air intake . You have to buy cooling pads and keep it on a hard surface not on cushions. 3) compressed air cans for cleaning insides is also necessary 4)plastic material so my keys broke in a few months and 5) lastly acer service is really bad buy something else if you dont live in a metro city
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,It's awesome for gaming and streaming videos
Acer-AN515-43-15-6-inch-Gaming-Windows,laptop,I need the battery but i can't find it so please suggest me where to buy battery of this laptop. Battery quality is so poor of this laptop
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,"Ryzen7 - better than Intel (google about it)  DELL - Long standing good reputation & after sales service  16 GB RAM - No more my phone has more Ram than laptop comments  512 GB SSD - Super fast file processing & less noise. Also helps blazingly fast start-up and shut down  14"" display - Neither too small nor too big. Perfect size to have  2-in-1 - Convenient to have laptop on top of your lap  Battery - Anything better than 6-7hrs is good. This one clocks about 10hrs, so great.  Tablet mode & touch with pen - Extras always good  Price - ₹80,000/- that is what I got it for. It appeals to me Very reasonable for specs laptop comes with.  Availability - This particular unit with same configuration not available in nearby (~4) authorised Dell stores & they are asking ₹10,000/- as advance with 10-15 days to make it available. Amazon delivers it in 3 days. -- Usage - I plan to use it as my work-from-home unit. Running 5-10pdfs and 5-6 Chrome tabs at one time and may be Vmware with Android to run a few work Android apps. With Windows 11 would not need Vmware? Dont know. ---- Alternative : I don't know why but I do really hate Apple products very much even without using one ever. That's silky I know. You can look into Macbook Air 13"" M1 chip weighs 1.29 kg and cost about 85-86K, if you want to. / Windows = Freedom. Dell = Trust + you can get it repaired anywhere!!! ---- Cons? None yet. I sincerely hope to find none in upcoming days. In case I do, I'll update here."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,What a beauty this machine is!! Delivered a day early and it's running smooth. Feels pretty premium. Recommended for light gaming and video editing. Easy to carry. Dell is awesome. Thanks
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,"Two things could have been better 1. screen is reflective 2. Edges are quite sharp rather than rounded.  Overall a good laptop at very competative price. Looks and feels solid, should last hopefully for years."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,Build quality feels premium and Ryzen 7 is smooth. The battery performance is good possibly due to the 4 lithium cells.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,"I bought this laptop on 27 Jul 21 during the Amazon sale for 89k. I was on the lookout for a premium 2 in 1 laptop for the last month or so. I had narrowed my choices accordingly and the Dell Inspiron 7415 was a strong contender. I finally chose the AMD RYZEN 7 5700U variant over the i7 11 generation variant based on their improved performance characteristics. The pre-sale day price was in the 83k range which I expected to drop during the sale days but was disappointed when I had to ultimately buy it at a higher price of 89k, probably due to the high demand on the model. Since I had researched the pros and cons in advance, I was aware that the display brightness of 212.5 nits was passable at best and not suited to outdoor use. But my usage was mainly indoors and therefore was a compromise I could live with. Similarly, the display panel used could have been better but seems to be a cost cutting measure. But, in the pros column, it's well crafted and built, light, has a high battery backup of 7-8 hours in normal usage, has fast booting due to its 512 GB SSD, responsive fingerprint scanner, sturdy hinge mechanism, responsive track pad and keyboard. The high performance processor and 16 GB RAM also means that multitasking is a breeze. The tablet mode is also extremely useful along with the pen, and adds an additional dimension to the utility of the laptop. Overall, I'm very happy with the laptop for my day to day usage and multitasking needs and would recommend it to anyone for whom the display and brightness issues aren't a deal breaker."
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,"Bought under 80k, good buy. AMD and Dell finally able to build good machine. Recommend"
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,Don't purchase the product and especially from Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. I received my product today. The screen has a yellow tint and camera is totally yellow.The maximum battery life is 10 years but would work for 6 hours only. Don't spend a single penny on this laptop and try to get a better one.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,Superb laptop. Mind blowing configuration at this price. Slim look and lovely design. Unquestionable performance. Thanks to Amazon.
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,Really good product for the price and amazing performance
Dell-Inspiron-7415-Integrated-D560472WIN9P,laptop,"Everything is amazing about the laptop. The only problems are low brightness 212 nits, sometimes speakers feel tinny overall good and the battery is close to 8 hours. The webcam is average but all laptops have average cameras. Camera physical shutter is very useful.  If it's strictly to be used indoors, go for it. Premium build. Good performance"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,Had ordered this laptop on 11th June considering its one day delivery and product came on 12th. On unpacking found that the laptop is damaged at one side and screen display was half gone. Raised a return request and when delivery person came he said cannot accept it please call customer care. And now customer care person says as its expensive item they have an internal mechanism so details will be updated in every station and it will take 72 hours for return and refund will be processed based on verification. Highly disappointed and annoyed by such service from Amazon.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,"five years after coming from Mac OS, initially, I was skeptical regarding the quality of the product, but I am happy to say I was wrong. it's clean, it's lightweight (should see for yourself). the only downside is the trackpad. I personally feel it awkward,its responsive but not as my 8 yrs old MacBook pro. 16 gb ram is breeze with intel processor. I got it on exchange of old on and its a fair deal to get such a small beast in 50k. 4 out of 5 in terms of look,quality,performance. kudos hp guys"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,"This product has 2 major issues, the machine heats up very fast, can't keep on the lap for 10 minutes continuously (although this is a LAPTOP); Second issue is the battery life, which is not as per the claims. it hardly lasts for 2 to 3 hours. Another issue was i could not activate the MS office, it says that i have already exceeded the number of activation. How could this be when i have only this laptop? I contacted amazon customer care, they directed me to contact Microsoft for further help. Contacting the Microsoft customer care was an huge task, i tried for 4 days on a regular basis however did not succeed. So here i am with unlicensed version of MS Office, asking me to activate every time i use MS Office."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,"I had been using a Macbook air, got this for my wife. Equally good and fast , light weight and better than Mac in many aspects. It's a breeze to use with bigger and bold Keys. You need not purchase Microsoft office as it is bunbled with it which I had to for Mac"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,It's a very nice laptop.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,"People should buy this Laptop to use it duirng winters only or in cool countries like Russia Alaska, it generates more heat than normally a heater would do and Laptops which heats a lot dont last long.  DO NO BUY...."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,"Sound is not good. But everything else is fine. Compact design, robust and fast. You will be having have same hardware configurations as Mac at cheaper price. For coding and work purpose it's good."
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,The screen size is small and cute
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,It's compact and a mini beast
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,Sound is not that good else everything is best.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,Good
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,"There is no anti-glare screen,screen quality is normal not too bad."

HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,"It's a very bad Laptop in terms of everything, they have just spoiled everything. The battery is very bad, the Laptop will start getting hang very soon guys. Don't buy. This laptop is not recommended gurs. The worst laptop I ever bought I didn't like the laptop This laptop got hanged very soon. I just used it for online class in got hanged. NEVER EVER BUY THIS LAPTOP INSTEAD BUY DELL INSPIRON"
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,It is very compact and high performing laptop. At this price range it is best choice. 16 gb ram is enough for multitasking.
HP-Pavilion-Laptop-Natural-13-bb0075TU,laptop,I am writting this review after 7 days of usage. This is an average product. Dont expect good battery backup. Its just 3-4 hours with average usage and backlid off. If you complain about the battery backup then service centre response is this is the best u can get 2-4 hours. So think before you buy
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,"Fully functional laptop at a reasonable cost. Windows 10 and MS Office. Fast start up with SSD. Large 15.6 inch screen. So far, it's been great!"
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,"This laptop has a very cheap quality plastic body. When i received the product the hinge connecting the screen had partially come off, and one of the plastic bits was lying inside the box (see pictures). I was about to return the product, but i snapped the hinge back in and the laptop started without any problems.  The specifications are quite decent for the price : 512 SSD, AMD Ryzen 3 quadcore, 4 GB RAM.If they had used better quality plastic in the body, i would have rated it higher.  No marks to Amazon, for really bad packaging. They had put the original laptop box without any kind of padding in a loose bigger box. Its a miracle that it reached me and is still working."
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,Laptops are very essential items nowdays. so i purchased this amazing product and very happy to say it has a good quality and effordable price.
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,"Trusted brand, value for money, fast, very very nice texture."
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,Laptop is awesome but u need to upgread ram...bcoz 4gb is not sufficient today uses...
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,Great product! Great speed. Performance is really impressive.
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Bought this for my cousin for his online classes, Ryzen 3 is more than enough and the SSD storage is an added advantage . RAM is only 4GB but it will get the JOB done, you can upgrade it to 8GB in the future.  Performance is good, webcam quality is just ok, overall features are good, but only problem I have that is regarding to the battery life which is not lasting long. It's working hardly for 4 hours. Although it takes only 2 hours to charge completely.  If you want better performance and a future proof laptop , go for this HP laptop here : amazon.in/gp/product/B08XNYN5QV  I hope it helps."
HP-Laptop-3K9U2PA-Windows-Warranty,laptop,"Bought it June 21 from local hp store... Upgraded with 8 gb ram which cost me 37500.00 store dealer provide a mouse , cleaning kit, laptop bag, and keyboard skin for free.. boot within 10 second.. realible performance.. only drawback is it comes without ms office.. availeble with Windows 10 home edition.. can update with Windows 11 when available. Overall good laptop 👍👍👍"

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"worst laptop brought ever. only one week since purchase and battery is showing its avatar. not even two hours of backup and I was running only normal applications (no games). graphics problems, most of the times window goes blur. even after all drivers are updated lots of problems and bugs in laptop. suggestion not to buy this laptop, prefer Asus over it. thank you HP, not worthy."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"5 mins and u will be clear; Bought this for 66k. casual gamer and an engineer doing 3rd year. Comparisons made ; >lenovo legion 5 amd ryzen 5 >lenovo legion 5i i5 10th gen >lenovo ideapad gaming 3 ryzen 5 4600h >asus tuf f 15 i5 10th gen >acer nitro 5 - using this for 10 days pros; 1). good battery than expected , 6 hours in google meet with wifi and bluetooth on with 70% screen brightness (from 11.30 amto 4.30pm , one hour lunch break but battery was at 30% at 4.30 pm so approx 6 hours) 2). stunning look when u see it in person 3) . less heting with a mild cooling fan noises 4) . audio quailty impressed me but not at the peak volume 5). boots in 10s.  cons; 1). typing in the keyboard is not that great , feels clunky sometimes 2). touch pad makes noise while tapping ,better use external mouse 3). screen lags sometimes , for normal use itslef 4).no additional applications included , hp omen is a trash 5) camera is clear only when direct sunlight or light hits in your face.  CONCLUSION 1 . choose this only if u need to add 1 more hour to your battery life , and nothing much. there is no major difference between 144Hz and 120Hz. 2. choose lenovo ideapad gaming 3 which is at 62k and u can use extra bucks for the ram upgrade, if battery is not a concern for u . lenovo keyboard is a pleasure to type in. 3. choose legion 5 if there is a stock available. ( i waited for like 2 months , my bad ) intel doesnt differ much from amd , but AMD is battery effecient. 4. choose asus tuff if heating is not a concern for u and need RGB , but u can always look after lenovo which is almost equaly priced , but trust me lenovos customer service is way better than any. 5. i didnt trust ACER as the other brands , u can ask your friends about that. ""FINALLY"" i tried returning this product to order lenovo , because i recogonised battery doesnt bother me , but amazon opted me only the service option where i have to mention the issue and hp will be sending their expert . click that helpful , and let others choose between their list . happy gaming ;)"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,Fantastic laptop I got it yesterday I got a good product thanku Amazon No single bad quality about it Everything is awesome Don't think to buy or not close your eyes and go with it It's just awesome Many of them leaves a bad comment but believe me it's a beast. Perfect laptop for gamers and students Keyboard is awesome Video quality sound quality and everything is superb Just go with it
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,Dont listen to others the laptop is fine It can run Triple a titles easily And battery is average i am getting about 4 hours with wifi and bluetooth on If u game forget the battery keep it plugged in The system doesn't heat a lot Its far better than asus a15 as it heats up a lot and the ryzen 7 throttles to give the performance of ryzen 5 The nvidia gtx 1650 is alright for me And 144hz refresh rate and 6 ms response time They all provide pretty good experience And display is above avg color reproduction is ok ok Overall if u want this laptop u can buy it it wont dissapoint u! The only con i found is less ubs ports
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"Buying any electronic product from Amazon is like inviting unnecessary loads in your life. The screen of the laptop stoped working in 15 days of purchase. Worst screen quality. It's too delicate to be a gaming laptop. Spending so much on a laptop and getting a defected one is hell of a nightmare. You'll have to make 100 of calls and spend your time to talk to customer service who are not at all ready to understand or help you. If you want to avoid unnecessary drama from your life then definitely don't buy this product. HP has lowered its standard now. This laptop is very delicate, needs utmost care while using or doing anything. Just don't buy it. JUST DON'T."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,Cheap plastic so it can break easily and the screen is shaking when we left up and down
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,Screen
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,Please don't buy costly products from Amazon if you want to save yourself from harassment. First I bought on 30th June but came defective as it had screen bleeding issue. So a replacement had been done which I received after 5 days. The replacement had the same issue as the 1st one. So amazon decided to refund the amount. After picking up the product and the initiation of refund there is total 17 days gap. And in between there are so many calls I had to make for the refund. Amazom service is really pathetic and painful. I just gave up everything. So be careful.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"This product is very good and securely packed and delivered. Working of the laptop is very smooth and quick with no lag. There are many different modes acc. To ur work and usage. Battery is pretty decent and good enough in this price range. Good if u are budget constrainted and searching for multitasking laptop then I would surely recommend “hp pavilion”. The ryzen makes it more fast I would recommend ryzen 5 over intel i5. Display is too good, there are no defects in the product delivered by Amazon. I have order many more things all were genuine with notch quality.. Thank you Amazon….Hope this info would be helpful to other buyers."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"It's a beast, awesome thermals, very powerful processor a decent graphics card and smooth 144hz refresh rate screen. Although I turned it down to 60hz for normal usage and browsing.(increases the battery life greatly). But when I game on it on 144hz its a whole another level of experience. Although the screen doesn't produce much detail due to less DPI. (Some things might seem blurry). The speaker is a minus point it has very less volume compared to your avg laptop. Overall it's a decent buy if you're a person like me who wants a laptop for normal usage as well as gaming. I bought it for 66,500"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"It is overall a good laptop. I am using it since almost a month. Below are my observations.  Screen is good enough for gaming and watching videos but it's not recommended for editing because I feel it produces little less accurate colors. If you want to edit something using this you better connect to your tv or good monitor to get accurate colors. And brightness levels also good enough. If you are inside it's good but if you open all windows in a room and watch a video with full brightness , some scenes are little difficult to see. But it's not a big problem.  Design is good. I really like it's look. It has sharp edges. When it's new, children should be little careful when they are around it. I feel laptop little heavy but not too much. Keypad is good but I don't like how up and down keys are too small. If you want to play a game using this up and down keys then it is uncomfortable. And touch pad is not in the middle but little to the left so when you type something you accidentally touch the touch pad.  Gaming is good experience till now on this laptop . I am not a heavy gamer but tried GTA5 and assassin creed valahalla on this laptop. I can play gta5 with good performance and thermals. But assassin's creed valhalla I can play on medium settings only. At this setting also visuals excellent gameplay is smooth. Thermals are good I feel it's getting hot but not too hot. That's what you should expect when you play AAA games.  Battery backup is decent. Without playing games it comes around 3 hours. I haven't tested playing games without charge because it's not recommended. I don't know about speaker quality since I never use my laptop without earphones. But as from the reviews it is good enough.  Bootup speed is high like less than 10 seconds. You can see the ports and connectivity information on product information. What they provided are enough for me. Laptop looks sturdy enough except if you press on top at the middle it goes little down.  Overall It has little flaws and many plus points. I am overall satisfied with the the product. I feel this should have 1650ti graphic card instead of 1650. Even it's not a big deal. If the laptop is slow at initial two days then Don't worry. It will download all updates and updates then it will be faster."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,I like all things in laptop but i have no wifi so i can't play gta5 so but laptop is awesome🥰
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,laptop is very good and can handle almost all games.  best laptop for work and gaming.
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"Pros: Specs Performance Portability ( very light) Backlight keyboard Customer support Cons: Build quality ( screen is wobbly) Cheap quality plastic on screen. ( Outside is good looking with matt finish) Battery life not as expected ( for regular use , lasting upto 2.5 hrs, in battery saver mode 4 hrs but performance will slow down . ) Special tip: DO NOT INSTALL CHROME. it defaultly takes more than 50%of your RAM ( 4 gb) . Better to use Microsoft edge (or) brave. Overall conclusion: Best laptop you can get in this price point. If you do not seriously consider the cons , you will definitely be satisfied. For me its good. Very good."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"This laptop is like best of the both worlds, processor and graphics card both are extraordinary and the screen quality is also very good, games in 144 hz refresh rate is a best feeling u can get in this one. Almost all the games and video editing platforms will be smooth like butter in this laptop. When u are expecting smoothness u should not think about battery life, nowadays all laptops rely on plugged in battery life, so other then battery everything is excellent, camera quality, audio quality are good too, the purple lights shouldn't bother u as, if u are not a purple person u can turn it off, Or if u are a black Panther fan then ur good to go"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"My only complaint is that it has only 1 USB port on either side. Could have had more but its alright Other than that, it is an excellent option for gaming. Runs Valorant at 112+ FPS Runs Genshin Impact at 60 FPS"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,Loved it!
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"Good laptop, but I was expecting better from hp. Although laptop has good specifications but compatibility is the issue. Screen lags sometimes while watching hd ""offline"" videos, this may be the problem with video players, but, every thing was not upto mark. Build quality is also not good, scratches and finger prints cannot be cleaned from it's surface."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,I had purchased this product second time and i can say that theres some serious issue with display of this laptop.

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,The performance and display are up to the mark...but the battery takes a hit. As of now only getting 2-4 hours of normal use time.

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"This is a product review as I did not buy this from Amazon. I bought this laptop from HP World , Chennai 1 month back. The laptop worked for 2 weeks after which the display had issues. It had colored vertical lines everywhere. I contacted HP support who did not investigate properly and replaced the display. It worked for hardly a day and then again the display went off with the same colored lines thus making it a laptop without any display. HP is clueless about what the issue is.The laptop is defective and i have been chasing HP for a replacement unit or a refund for the last 2 weeks. This is pathetic support and a bad product from HP. I suggest you buy this laptop only if you don't care about your hard earned money."
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"Hello to all of you who reading my comment this laptop is 67,000 but the lower version is 59,000 i would say that you extra paying for the higher version for only 1 extra ssd and that's ony 256 gb so I prefer to buy the lower version you can add the ssd after market an that's only for 4,000 paying to ssd and you add the ssd only for 4000"
HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-4600H-15-ec1048AX,laptop,"Fantastic product. Battery life is good. Gaming is fun for my son on this laptop. Good sound. Back light color looks a bit childish, should have given a choice for back light. Overall happy with this purchase."
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"I was bored from intel i5 hence went for Ryzen. Personal experience Ryzen is way better than intel Coming to laptop this is one of best you can get at this price. Pros Super fast boot up faster processing. 1TB Memory, 8GB RAM and Nice display I have not used for hardcore gamming but I use CAD & heavy 3d graphics software which works very smoothly Not lighting fast as dedicated pc but yes system wont make you wait for loading I have tried Call of Duty & God of War apart from screen size I was having a play station experience Cons First I would like to point out battery life, it is hardly 3-4 hours. Can't use for long time without charging but yes it charges faster Second it could had come with better inbuilt speaker. Quality of sound is good but volume is a concern. While watching movies i either have to switch off fans or put Bluetooth speaker. Doesn't have LAN port I am using a converted from LAN to HDMI makes it difficult to use monitor as I dont have Wi-Fi signal strength Gets heated up while gaming Keys could have been improved. Sometimes feeling like tapping instead of pressing.  Overall If you are looking a multipurpose(gaming, design, business & personal use) laptop at economical price, this one if good has value for money. It could be more better but yes nothing is perfect."
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"if, unlike me, you care for long battery life and good display this ain't for you. You can play any game on this laptop at medium or sometimes high settings. Battery life ios not the best. 1 hour on gaming, 4-5 hours on content consumption and 3-4 on light work related thing and viewing angles are not good too. But if performance is what you want, then this is the best in the price category!"
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Super slow laptop. Don't buy this laptop. It takes very very long time to boot and then all applications work very slow and get hung often. It's Lenovo V15 AMD Ryzen 5. Very very very poor performance
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Good product
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"over the performance, it works like a charm for daily usage. heats a lot on longer usage, less battery backup, 3 hours max on high brightness. Sound is average, headphone works great as it supports Dolby Audio no comments on graphics as it has Readon graphics which is great for Gaming. played Asphalt and no lag found."
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Volume is hardly audible This problem needs to be fixed
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Too slow. Does not work as you would expect an i5 competition to work. The webcam also refuses to work 3 out of 5 times.
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Very good 👍 😊 product . Sound is clear and loud graphics are also good. But the boot time is little slow. Battery time about 2-3 hour.
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"Very slow processing,even worst then a 2gb ram Using this laptop from 4 months and found the system is very SLOW and the battery life is about 1-2 hours on heavy usages and around 3hrs on battery saver mode. Even got my laptop damaged but now fixed by a local service center They gave no warranty on physical damages."

Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,I can't say anything as I used intel Pentium earlier if was super slow and switching to ryzen 5 is like a boost. I prefer buying DOS one and installing linux. Battery life is not good And yes when I bought this ab Asus was shortlisted but I choosed this but I prefer that more.
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,I only used it for office work . But it lacks and i tried gaming laptop becomes hot . Stuck
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"Worst product, no battery backup although it shows a battery backup of 5 hours it hardly runs for 2 hours. The processor is so so slow you will get irritated by using it. Waste of money totally....."
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"This is my first laptop and I don't have anything else than good things to say about it. It is slow while opening programs but thats on the pre installed hdd not on the computer. Is good for most games. The only thing somewhat bad with it is the viewing angle. But thats it. Ignore the bad reviews plz ( I did too, because its hard to find a ryzen 5 processor at this price range) and buy this beast. And btw everything is upgradeable except the processor."
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,It's nice purchase but be warned of purchasing for online classes don't Volume is very low... Rest battery backup as mentioned not dat gr8.
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"camera quality quality is too low, and sound is also very low, you cant even hear anything during zoom call or confrence call. do not buy this."
Vivobook-X515MA-EJ001T-Silver-Intel-Celeron,laptop,Is a good laptop in this cost I liked it...
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"CONS 1. SOUND IS LOW  FEW TIPS FOR BUYERS 1. Do not just look at the product but also read the seller reviews 2. Games are played while laptop is plugged in, if you wanna play on battery do not expect 6hr battery life and while doing normal work etc battery life is good"
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Simply superb... didn't find any issues Just need to install ms office
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,The laptop volume would be lesser than a normal mobile volume..if asked they would say this model is manufactured in that way..so please be cautious..volume veryyyyyy low than a normal mobile phone

Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,The startup takes too much time to load. Even the lock screen freezes sometimes. You only get 5 gb usable ram. And operating system isn't that great compared to other brands like asus in similar price range.

Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"Honestly this laptop is a decent one it can do entry level gaming and handle almost all kinds of popular work related applications.. Yes the display could have been slightly better and battery life too And one more suggestion if u want to get the most out of it add an nvme sad to the available slot and u will be amazed at how fast it will make your boot speeds.. Now the games I have tried on this laptop 1. Gta V 1080p medium 40 fps 2.valorant 1080p low 70-80 fps 3.witcher 3 720p low 30 fps 4. Far cry 4,5,new dawn 720p 30 fps 5. Apex legends 720p 40fps 6. Watchdogs 2 720p 25-30 fps And few more"
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Very bad product don't buy any lenovo product from Amazon After sale service of lonovo is very bad and amazon don't intertane after 10 days of delivery.
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,lenovo laptops have very poor performance. within 2 months of purchase its hard disc stopped functioning and the customer care never bothered to replace. even its camera was not functioning properly . so better avoid this brand.
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"Very disappointed , Very Slow booting and dead slow performance better not to take this Lenovo laptop Thank You ."
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Have been using this quite long time( though bought from local vendor). Just too good. the only point of concern is battery backup. Otherwise performance is really good
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"Worst products ever and service is Terrible and pathetic. Battery dies at 70% automatically. Service centet took almost 20 days to resolve issues, but no satisfactory results are obtained"
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,The biggest drawback of this laptop is the USB ports are present in left side which is not appreciable for mouse or keyboard extension. I was planning to buy it but due to this I won't.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Laptops works perfectly with no issues. Looks new with very little signs of use.
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Super fast boot in 4 second with ssd. FHD screen. Num keyboard. Super battery backup. Most valuable price. Ryzen 5 with vega 8 graphic
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Go for it Best quality product with fast boot speed Best for gaming and student with good looks and good speaker quality
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Nice!! But battery problem i don't like this type of problems and for gaming is 🙂 to be a good
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Link loosks cool but .. performance wise slow really disappointed.. although return window closed in 1weel only and o was in isolation..
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,"Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind."
Lenovo-V15-Windows-Graphics-82C7003PIH,laptop,Think it's price should be more compared to its performance of the laptop. Ryzen 5 with 8 gb ram is very good.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"I'm a big fan of Latitude series, based on that I tried to buy even a renewed latitude laptop but the seller sent a nearly 7 year old machine (verified with the Dell service tag) at a huge price of 30K. The original machine was compatible for Windows 7 but the seller sent it with Windows 10 that had driver compatibility issues. I booted the laptop and soon after that it threw the recovery / driver incompatible related errors many times (refer the attached pics). I preferred to return the laptop and I'm thankful to Amazon for accepting the return and refunding the money. I'd not recommend to go for this product."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Not a Dell product for sure. The overall body looked very cheap and the back panel was made of cheap plastic and had many broken parts. The charger and the adaptor was also not genuine. Very disappointing and a lesson learnt
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I could have given 1 star only because the product did not really work. But the seller here has played a awesome part. The 4 stars are for them. They have provided a replacement of a defective product within warranty. Thanks to the seller and Thanks to Amazon for creating a bridge between the original seller and customer.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I have been using this Laptop for more than 15 days now and its performance and quality looks good.  The Customer service is really good. I had some issue with the charger last week and it has been immediately replaced. Thanks to Subhash who assisted in this process of replacement.  Thanks team.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Please take the laptop back. Do not want this, it's very slow and dont want to use it Please take this back"
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Front camera is missing and the monitor plastic support is also damaged. Strongly not recommended.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,it was better than expected working completely fine..it's been 2 months since I've been using it and there has been no fault as such.. satisfied
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Sir,I want to tell u..Sound is also very less..Even if I go 100%..Is this problem in particular model. Or anything else..Pl check.."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,TouchPad was broken. Crack on screen. Specs mentioned were different.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Nice laptop having good battery cheap price and good processor
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,good laptop against it's value
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Charging issues
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"I bought this as a school laptop for my son. I was surprised that this looks like a brand new item - I expected scuffs and marks from a refurbished item, despite the Certified Refurbished status. The laptop is flawless. Robust, this is an ideal laptop for a student. Actually, the specs mean it's better than almost every other device at twice the price retail in Australia. i5 processor, 8GB Ram, SSD drive - this thing flies! Amazingly fast boot time, so while other laptops in the class are still spinning away waiting for the lock screen to load, this one's already logged in, online and working. The one disadvantage - and it may be a deal-breaker for others - is the combined weight of the laptop and the power adapter. Dell took a while to work out that power adapters shouldn't require a wheelbarrow to cart around, and this one isn't an exception. However! I can't believe it, a so-called refurbished device with a battery that goes ALL DAY. I kid you not, after two days of lugging the adapter around, my son now leaves it at home, easily getting through a school day beginning on a full charge and returning with power to spare. On the odd day where he's been using a bit more battery than usual, he uses Windows 10's built in eco mode, which gives the lappy some legs (Oh, and it shipped with Windows 10 ready to go). Can't fault this laptop - should have bought two at the price. (Sorry about the out of focus photos - too excited)."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"This notebook was shipped fast and arrived in less than perfect packing. Maybe it was a refurbished unit but I doubt it because it is in perfect condition with nary a fingerprint on it. It arrives with scant documentation. One sheet of paper to tell you where to find the Win10 activation key and a 2nd piece of paper to tell you to make USB emergency Windows boot key. No manual. After I booted it up for the first time I initially panicked because the track pad did not work and I had trouble getting thru the Win10 setup screens. I then plugged a wireless mouse into it and was able to navigate the setup screens. Win10 need a TON of updating which took a very long time. Track pad started working after updates. Now that the machine is fully updated I am extremely pleased with this laptop. The SSD boots into Windows very fast. The WIFI works great. 8GB of ram is perfect. The battery performs like new and holds a charge for a very long time. My wife uses it and doesn't need more hard drive space because she only uses the web browser and MS Office online version. She saves lots of stuff in the MS cloud drive. So storage is just fine. The SSD still shows about 80gb of free space. At this price point you can't go wrong. I purchased this unit to replace an HP Stream 14 purchased at Walmart. The HP Stream was awful and included only 32gb of system memory you couldn't even update the HP stream due to very small HD size. I returned it and got this one for less than $100 more and it's perfect. The i5-4300u processor is no slouch - it's powerful. I think we'll get a lot of use out of this machine. It's much better than old laptops I paid over $1,000 for. EDIT: I just realized the laptop I received does NOT have the mouse/toggle between the B-G-H keys. However, the photo on Amazon does. No biggie - I never use that thing anyway."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,The camera is not working and thete is no ckear picture
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"I was fooled by the title and the “date first available on Amazon”. Make no mistake, this is an old laptop. 4 years old exactly. That aside, with 8GB RAM and a solid state hard drive, it’s still a decent machine. The 4th gen i5 CPU, although less efficient than new ones is still faster than the CPUs in many of the similarly priced new economy laptops (Pentium N).  I purchased two reconditioned laptops from this seller and had two totally different experiences. This was the good experience. The other laptop went back.  Unlike the other, which had a dead battery and nonfunctional keyboard, this one looks and works like new, battery included."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"The setup instructions were not the best and I had to work out a few things on my own. It never asked for the Microsoft product key during setup, but after windows loaded a few times it finally stated it did not have an active product key. I was able to add it then through the Microsoft store. This wasn't a big problem for me to get through, but I am handy with computers. For the computer itself, it is amazing. It is not lightweight, but isn't ridiculously heavy. It has a thicker base, maybe from having the DVD drive. We really didn't want the DVD drive, but the other specs on this system were so great that we took that hit; and it was well worth it. The system shuts down in about 3 seconds. The boot time is very, very fast. The speakers are very loud. The system was clean and looks brand new. I looked at installed programs and there is almost nothing there, just the essentials, so the system appears to be perfectly wiped clean in the refurb. The thing that I like over my other laptop is that the track pad isn't oversized, it is just perfect. On my other laptop the track pad is so large that I always touch it and move the mouse/cursor while I am typing."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"This is a slightly older Dell laptop. It's durable and capable. I added an MSATA drive (there's a slot for that) and it's performing nicely. I also upgraded the internal wifi card to a 5Ghz AC one. That made a big difference, doubling the network speed up to about 200Mbps. The stock one hovered around 90Mbps on 2.4Ghz.  The retailer was responsive to my questions. For the price, it was a great deal. One note though. This contains the 'M' series core processors. That means they're low voltage, which saves the battery, but a tad slower having only 2 physical cores ""double-pumped"" to 4 threads.  If you need a good business-class laptop at a reasonable price, this is the one for you."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"For under $300, I don't know if you can beat this laptop. My laptop arrived in near perfect condition; there's a tiny crack on the bottom left corner of the keyboard, but it's just cosmetic and hasn't caused any issues while in use. It's a bit on the heavier side than I was anticipating, but it does have a CD-ROM drive, so it makes sense. The initial set up took less than 15 minutes and it runs incredibly fast (booting up takes about 30 seconds, if that). The battery life is pretty awesome, and the keyboard layout is great and the model I received does have a keyboard back light (which is not a feature I realized I enjoy so much, so that was a nice bonus). I use a newer model of this line for work and although this model is older, it has the same feel to it. To be honest, I'm mildly obsessed with this thing."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I ordered this to take an online class. IT DID NOT COME WITH A CAMERA. THE BATTER LIFE IS NOT THAT GREAT. THE CHARGER IS HUGE AND GETS TOO HOT. I really think it is an older model because the keyboard area is covered in black contact paper.  It does get online prety well but I can't study in a public place because I can't use the headphones. This laptop is better for a kid than an adult
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"I liked ease of use,performance was fast,very nice laptop for the money,the only reason for not 5 stars on everything was ask if lightweight to me fine ,but I can see if people are already used to some of the other laptops out there this would seem not so lightweight, and for the battery lif I really didn’t have time to test, it was destroyed by wildfire here in paradise ca"
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I bought this lap top primarily to play backup music on gigs. I leave it disconnected from the internet and don't use it for online shopping. I always plug it in when I use it so I don't worry about the battery. The speaker has static which is probably due to a loose connection. The headphone jack works so I don't care about the built in speaker. The price is good for my use.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"My father was blown away by the speed. Buyer beware with refurbished, though. You never know what you'll get. Did they fix the symptoms or the underlying problem? If they fixed the underlying problem, great. If they only fixed the symptoms, expect to be returning the unit. It's up to you if you're willing to take the risk."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I don't like that the dealer misrepresented the product. * Dealer didn't supply key for Windows 10 Pro and I had to purchase a new key from windows. I tried to contact dealer no call back before purchasing the key to operate the laptop. I basically purchase a shell that i coul have purchase for no more than 70.00.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Screen has dead spots in the back light, very noticeable problem. Windows 10 Product Key had the silver scratched off already, exposing the full key, yet Windows was not activated."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I wanted a robust laptop that would serve me for a few years for various uses. This computer meets all the requirements to work quickly. It also has 8gb RAM which makes it even faster.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I needed a solid work laptop computer for cheap. This is it. It was a bit dirty so I cleaned it up and wham! Better than new and it keeps on truckin'
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Fairly easy to set up, just did not prompt me to install Windows 10 upgrade per enclosed instructions. Had to do after step afterward. Works well, pleased with purchase."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Amason forces you to go through India to have warranty work done. These people do not speak English nor do they understand English and Amason knows this is true and that is why they force customers to go through this HELL. I gave up Life is to short for me to submit to ever again put myself through this HeLL I will never again buy big ticket item from amason
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Great value, great seller, fast shipping. Had a small problem, they took care of imeadetly"
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Great laptop for my kids to use for grade school! Enough power to use for my own work also! Awesome purchase!
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,LIKED ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING FOR THE PRICE ALSO!
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"I bought this for my daughter's school work. Very quick, great screen, works perfectly."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"On the surface the laptop was looking good, but I wasn't able to power it on, tried several times to no avail. Lesson learned: do not buy refurbished c*ap."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"good evening  On September 9, I bought a dell laptop, the same one in the photo indicates having a camera and it is not.  See the model and see how it came to me physically, it is in bad taste when an buyer wants an item and when it arrives it is below the quality seen on the page."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,The quality control is poor. The SSD was loose in the laptop. The drive was not secure because the hard drive cradle was not used. The SSD could be easily heard moving back and forth in the laptop.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I ordered a Dell laptop and it came two days later. It’s like new not a scratch on it and it runs smoothly. It’s been years since I had a computer and I needed some initial help. I sent an email through Amazon and had the answer immediately. Can’t say enough about how grear IT Hardware is!
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Fair price, functions properly"
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Works and looks like brand new.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,The computer works well. The price is more than fair. Shipping was prompt. Customer support is excellent.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Complete garbage!! All I did was hit the power button to power it up and it can’t even do that! I thought this junk was tested??? give me a break Amazon!! Don’t waste your time and money.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Stay away from this computer if you need the internet. Unable to get the airplane mode turned off and wifi turned on. Common problem with windows 10 but unable to fix on this computer.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"The touchpad stops working half the time, the other half it doesn't respond properly; it won't accurately move or it will start jumping around. I tried removing gestures and precision helping and it's still busted."
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Muy buena máquina
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,This is an excellent laptop for the price! I've worked these models of laptops a lot in my field of work. Its fast and does the job for all my office and diagnostic software. Would definitely recommend.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,So far it is exactly what I need.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,My unit arrived with a warped keyboard and a dead pixel on the computer screen.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,Love it other than it doesn’t have a camera
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,I bought this as a used laptop for my father. He loves the speed of internet. We are both happy with this item.
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Did not match description, but my daughter loves it!"
Dell-Latitude-E5440-14in-Notebook,laptop,"Great product, very fast, almost like new, and works great with all the programs I need for work. Just waiting on a new laptop battery and this will be the best value buy I've ever made"

Lenovo-V15-ADA-82C700H4IH-Laptop-Graphics,laptop,I got defective non booting laptop from day 2 I'm trying to return it but pickup executive not picking laptop every times gives silly reasons and make me fool it's been 7 days laptop is not picked Amazon service getting worst day by day. I have spend 28000 ruppes in this but laptop is not picked and I don't get and refund yet. Amazon harrased me very badly
Lenovo-V15-ADA-82C700H4IH-Laptop-Graphics,laptop,"Decent laptop under 30K but a bit low on memory. Sometimes it freezes when too many tabs are open in browser. Should consider 8GB version of the same. build quality is excellent. weight is only 1.5KG Unfortunately no USB-C port. Also I would have expected windows 10 pre-installed for that price, but all you get is only freeDOS Good laptop for everyday browsing and presentations."

I'm writing this review after 2 days of usage, so it'll be my initial impressions. * The processor is of HF variant that means it doesn't have integrated intel graphics. So all the gpu related tasks are handled by Nvidia gpu(1650 GDDR5) and remains active all the time. However the activity percentage varies according to workload. I think this is one of the reason of poor battery life. * For basic tasks like watching online videos, browsing web, editing documents etc., I only got around 3 hours of battery life with balanced mode. It can be slightly increased by turning on power saver mode. * Hybrid mode is not available in Lenovo vantage app. * Display quality is very good according to me(as I'm coming from TN panel), but the brightness level is not that high. I had to keep it at least 80% always for better visibility in a room with normal lighting. It's a 60Hz panel. * The HDD model is WDC WD10SPZX 5400 rpm. * The SSD model is Micron MTFDHBA256TCK."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I got it for 63,990 rupees without applying any additional discounts on 23rd june 2020, which is really a very good deal It is amazing laptop. Built quality is really premium. But it is very heavy for me. Display quality is very good. It given me 5 hour of battery in my first experience. It includes 1 month trial of ms office and McAfee antivirus, which should be given for atleast 1 year.  My model: 1TB+256ssd, gtx 1650, 8gb ram.  Will update you after a month use.  Edit : After 4 months of use, battery is still lasts around 4 hours and performance is up to the mark."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Received the product today, it is good, everything is nice and flawless so far.  But the outer cover packaging of amazon was very poor that the entire cardboard tore off, at first I thought it was tampered with, but after a good examination realised it was poor packaging and was not tampered"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I loved the Piece, amazing at Gaming, doesn't even heat much even tho I am gaming on Extreme Graphics and have multiple apps open, glad I bought this :) Superb Purchase."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Likes include: 1) Screen and graphics quality 2) smooth touchpad and keys  Dislikes include: 1) Worst battery life. Only lasts 2 hours after a full charge. Btw this was without playing any games yet. I only used it for programming. 2) very heavy to carry around 3) No laptop bag provided 4) The screen hinges are worst and not at all flexible. When u try to adjust the screen forward or backward it feels like it can get stuck or break at any point. 5) Slow in starting up. My other laptop from lenovo which is 4 yrs old starts faster 6) Harman speakers SUCK big time. I think its duplicate of harman. Again my 4 year old laptop speakers are louder than this one. 7) The charger heats up very quickly and it is way too bulky and heavy 8) Camera quality also SUCKS. Overall i would not recommend buying this laptop whether u r a gamer or programmer. I wasted paying 63k for a piece of METALLIC JUNK which should only cost 30k. Therefore Lenovo, if u guys are listening, this product of yours is the WORST OF THE WORST."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Great laptop with the following pros and cons...  Pros: 1. Great display 2. Very good thermal management. 3. Great performance.  Cons: 1. Little bit screen bleeding issue, although common in IPS screens. 2. No integrated gpu from Intel. Not much of a big deal though. 3. 3-4 hrs of battery life in normal usage w/o gaming (in balanced mode)."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Laptop is decent, hybrid mode is not available despite updating BIOS (HF variant). Around on balance performance gives ~2hrs. Packaging was worse, tapes were not put properly and they have kept the laptop box in a way bigger box with no fillings in btw so whenever the whole box moves the laptop box moves hard. This unprofessional packaging can damage the product, luckily mine seems ok for now."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"This is a pretty good laptop. Decent build quality. 10/10 looks, more professional than gaming (due to lack of rgb keyboard). SSD is pretty fast. Getting around 3-4 hrs on Battery Saving settings.  GTA 5 runs at 30 FPS in Very High settings with negligible heating. The thermal design and cooling system is pretty good.  Valorant at around 180-200 fps with everything at low and V Sync off.  Screen is good, not the best and brightest outthere, but it does the job.  Sound quailty is above average for laptops at this price range.  Build is plastic but feels sturdy. It's a huge fingerprint magnet tho :/  Keyboard is excellent and the lightning is pretty good too.  Will update after 1-2 months of usage.  Trust me, it's worth paying the 5-10k premium over competitors."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Best entry level gaming laptop. Just a heads up for anyone who didn't know this laptop has i5 9300HF chip. HF series don't have integrated intel hd graphics. Means no hybrid mode where you can switch from nvidia to integrated graphics to save battery.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I have been using the Legion Y540 (Intel i5 GTx 1650 8gb ram) for about 3 weeks now and I have to say it's one hell of a laptop. The SSD helps with fast boot up. No lag,crisp display, decent speakers. Battery life is just above average. Normal heating nothing more than that. I have been playing CS go for sometime with the built in screen recorder and there is no lag and also coding is super smooth and easy.It does take some time to get used to the keyboard layout but it's nice. It would have been just perfect if it had a better battery and a bit more premium finish (although the quality is excellent). Amazon packaging was terrible still the Laptop's box was in good condition. If you are looking for a gaming laptop between 60-70k I would strongly recommend this spec."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Pros All spec's are good Except the Battery backup.  We can play any type of games, but some games are need to change the graphics settings to medium.  Cons Battery backup not good. Discharging very fast while using the product.  Ok ..go for it."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"It's a capable machine for gaming cyberpunk 2077 runs around 40 frames at 1080p at low and 60 frames at 720p at medium, despite the glitches. GTA V at 80 frames on high at 1080p. Witcher 3 at 70+ frames at max (hairwork turned off). Apex legends 80+ frames at max settings.  Battery life on the other hand is dependent on your workflow, this perticular model 9300HF doesn't have an integrated Intel graphics, so the GTX 1650 runs all the time which sucks a lot of charge.  Personally it doesn't bother me carrying a 2 kilo weight around classes, but maybe different for others, the num pad is something people will need to get used to.  Doesn't heat that much highest recorded on mine was 76°C on prime 95, while rendering a clip in Resolve max recorded was 70°C (undervolt of -1.135v). Results may vary during summer.  Be careful of the keyboard deck it gets dirty easily because of the soft touch plastic."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I'm writing this review after 41 days of continuous and rigorous use of this beast Laptop.  Firstly, This is a best laptop u can get for this range and it contains the features worth 1Lac and you are getting this at 60k, so I guess it's the best deal ever.  Battery life --> good (4-5hrs) Gaming --> I play GtaV and Formula 1.I had very good gaming experience. The brand NVIDIA tells u all.😁  I also use heavy softwares such as matlab, xilinx and It's works simply great without any buffer so I recommend this laptop.  Lastly, Every laptop will have its cons. The cons in this laptop is its webcam. It is situated right above the keypad and we have to bend the laptop much to fit our face into the screen. But I guess it's not a very big deal.  Lastlt, Thank you lenovo for this beast."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,They sent me a laptop which was 3 months into warranty. Clearly a used and returned product. The inner box too was damaged. Returned it for a refund. Please all check your warranty status via Lenovo help tool. Its the only way to know if you have been sent a second hand unit.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,The product was warranted for 12 months but warranty card shows warranted for10 months. Product was delivered on 29 may 2021 but warranty started on 26 April 2021 it means product was used by someone
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Writing this review after using the product for 3 days The package was delivered on 27 th and was in good condition Pros - Performance is just awesome Windows is installed on ssd so system boots within seconds Gameplay is awesome thanks to the nvidia 1650 No heat or lag issue on heavy gaming till now  Cons Battery life is average It gives 3-4 hrs on normal usage And 1-1.5 hrs on gaming  For the ones who are confused about thr HF processor - The F stands for fused integrated graphics , ie you wont get integrated graphics with your processor , it doesn't matter much because anyway they are disabled in gaming laptops"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Laptop is really performing well. Iam not a severe gamer i bought it for my CAD softwares and it does work really well.The only demerit is the battery backup as it is a gaming laptop you cannot expect more than 4hrs. If this was better it seems a perfect laptop for me.You will also get frustrated with the awkward placement of the web cam its really a waste if ur thinking of having a video call u better go for webcam externally.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"This laptop is amazing! Here's some Pros and cons  Pros- • The laptop is quite slim • The panel is really good an has amazing colours • The leds on the keyboard are really bright • The performance of the i5 & 1650 are really good, 50+ fps on most games at High - Very High • The track pad is really good, it's very accurate  Cons - • The theramls of the cpu are quite high I recommend undervolting • The Keyboard is quite mushy • The fan noise is quite high • The battery life is okay, 3 hrs are quite good for a gaming laptop. Wouldnt excatly say this is a con but it's neither a pro. • The panel is 60hz.  A four starts from me, go for it I recommend it highly.  DISHCAW DISHCAW"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Laptop performance is really good. Its been 2 month i am using this laptop. Perfect laptop for machine learning and gaming.  Battery performance can be batter.  Only poor part was product packaging. Delivery boy was bring laptop on their sholder and there were no proper packaging.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I have always been a huge fan of Lenovo Thinkpad series since 2005. No wonder I picked it up and as always Amazon did a fantastic job of delivering it on time as promised. 5 Star rating for Amazon service, as usual.  The product is just mind-blowing as per my use. I don't use it for games as such. Regular office use - browsing, etc. However, I got it for a very reliable deal and I didn't blink to pick it up. I exchanged my old Lenovo Thinkpad T430 and almost got a discount of 10K. So, net-net, I got this Lenovo Legion for just 47K - which is a steal.  Pros: The display is world-class, the mouse-pad is super-silky. Start-up booting is super smooth. Just a couple of seconds. All windows open and close like a blink of an eye - no sound, no noise, and quick. Switching between windows is such a breeze. Battery life in the case of a power cut is awesome.  Areas of Improvement: Not many - just a couple:  1. Camera positioning is very weird at the bottom of the LCD display. Especially for video calls, Zoom meetings, etc., I have to sprain my neck looking down. If I look at the screen for any reason, it looks weird to the audience. I had invest another 2K for buying a Logitech Webcam and place it on top of the panel. That serves the purpose.  2. Keyboard is a bit oddly placed. If you are used to the traditional Lenovo Thinkpad - your fingers automatically land at the wrong places. Perhaps the number pad on the right is for gaming purposes I am assuming... Haven't found a use for it yet - hence it is a waste of space for me.  3. The power cable charger panel is very bulky - almost feels like carrying a brick in the bag. I wish it was a bit handy.  Overall very much satisfied with the product. Go for it!"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"It's been 2 days now.. Laptop is working fine... Battery backup 3.5hrs+ while standard use While gaming it could be about 2-2.5hrs For gaming it's doing well I tested COD, Battlefield,Kingdom Come Deliverance and it is working fine, lags a bit sometimes for KCD but it's not consistent. Other than that works smooth like a hot knife on butter... Good Buy"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I got it for 53k (exchanged my 9 year old laptop and Amazon was kind enough to give me 6.5k for it), so I cannot complaint much about it. The styling is very understated and i really like it. Build quality is great and excellent finishing. The battery life is average, around 3 hours on regular use. However, the weakest link has to be the screen. It gets bright only till 240 nits, which is fine for indoor use, but under sunlight, you will struggle. The placement of the camera is also awkward. All in all, it's an excellent buy if you are a casual gamer. I use it for my work and play fifa, nfs and forza, which I beleive it can handle well."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,This is certainly not worth it. The battery drains even while the laptop is shut down. I charged it a night ago and didn't use it since then. Next morning when I turned it on 20% of the battery was already drained. Not sure what Lenovo is trying to do by introducing such products which are faulty and don't live up to the hype.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Ok so the product, wonderful. I was wondering if the i5 9th gen processor will be good or not but it was wonderful. The vantage software slightly overclocks it so as to get good performance. The graphics and gaming performance is seamless, and I can play AAA titles easily. I've played Assassin's creed Odyssey, DC Injustice 2, GTA V, Forza Horizon 4, and all works wonderfully without a glitch(medium-high settings). My most favourite feature with this laptop is the thermals. The fans are ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL, they suck in air and spit it out with such efficiency, I've only seen the body get hot once or twice that too just a bit, not the cooking oven temperatures other laptops achieve. So the dual fans work like a charm, even though I find raising the back of the laptop a bit as helping with thermals a lot(as the intake in under the lap). I've used some very good gaming customising software like the asus armory crate, so I find the Lenovo vantage software as just overkill. It's not that great and it's mundane, and don't offer much customisation. But it's ok so no worries. I've seen many guys complain about the battery life of the laptop, whining that they only get 3 hrs of battery life, to be honest people, u only get 3 and 4 hrs maximum in gaming laptops, that's the industry standard, if u want u idiots better look for a notebook or something. It's just annoying finding so many people complain about something that the common standard The display is good and all but not that bright but that's how many companies keep the price down, by compromising on the screen quality. The keyboard is membrane and not mechanical but that's expected in most laptops in this range, but it's got good travel and it's not too bad, I like the keyboard, so no problems. I've bought the 1TB HDD and 256 GB SSD version and to all the guys out there please change your default storage to your HDD cause of that 256 u lose a big chunk for windows so it will fill up fast so change it to the HDD. The charger is pretty chunky and big so that's a small problem, but a very small one. The keyboard isn't RGB only blue light but it's not a big problem for me, but if u want it, this is not the lap for u. So overall the laptop is wonderful and inlove it, it even works well with primiere pro and photoshop and all. Haven't used it to render so don't know about that. But overall it's a wonderful laptop with great performance and all the perks of a gaming laptop."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I bought it for 64k in an offer.I am writing this review after 40 days got the product.This is simply superb,i got no other product at this price with the mentioned specs.when it comes to battery its not bad,it allows you to work continuously for 3-3.30hrs once it charged 100%,but 1-1.30hrs for gaming. Camera quality is good,but what makes little bit worry about it is position of cam (below the screen),but it gives best screeing experience with thin bezel up and sides. Though it is gaming laptop,it gives very professional look unlike other gaming laptops. Its build quality is also good."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Now after 2 months of use . Suddenly Hdd is missing, SSD is still available. I have tried calling Lenovo Service Center but no response. Guys dont buy its waste of money. Better you guys go buy some mac with the same money."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Runs most of the games at 40-100 fps Depending on the settings. For its price it is worth it and u can go for it. But if you want to get a solid 60-120 fps go for higher laptop but if you are a casual gamer definitely go for this.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"The design is absolutely super and the display is also good ( really nothing to complain about ) but, the camera can be made bit high resolution (1080p) and the battery is draining fast (3 hrs on high performance ) any how, for this design and its purpose it is ooookay!! Overall it is a good laptop and classy laptop.  and the ports are all back ( i really love that) for that thanks!!!!"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Nice laptop for the budget gamers out there and it performs seamlessly without any lag thanks to the ssd and hdd hybrid setup the nvidia gtx 1650 performs very well with 60 FPS capped continuously because of 60 HZ display the ips panel provides true colour immersion Overall a great budget product for professional workers and gamers as well. Also in terms of editing and videography this performs really well the premier pro works well with this setup and no lag felt while rendering. In conclusion go for it and you will not get disappointed but only con it has is the battery backup otherwise all others are very impressive.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Pros : This laptop is great for budget gamers , Streamers and a mid level programmer , this comes with a Nvidia 1650 which is decent for gaming and can run games like Valorant , Pubg Pc , Apex legends , GTAV very easily on more than 60 Fps .  2 : Battery Life is Decent .  3 : Screen is 60hz which i good at this price point .  4: Decent Build .  Cons : Bad Camera Placement and poor Quality ."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Hi, i bought this laptop for my son at independence sale for 59000. Product came in good packing. Its a value for money laptop with great specifications i.e, 8gb RAM, 256gb SSD, 1tb HDD, i5 9th generation chip, 4gb nvidia graphics card etc. High definition games run smoothly with 60 plus frame rates. I have ZERO issues with it and one can go for it without second thoughts."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Itss a realy great product For this price range .. I have used this for around 6-7 months  No lag aur delay that i have experienced till now You might Find battry life little annoying It losses battry life real quick if you use everything at high graphics/setting They show that its battry life is around 5 hrs but its around 3-4 hrss You have to use it with charging on while gaming  I haven’t faced must isses while gaming It’s pretty good product at the price range it’s available  Plus Points: Good gaming Experience No lag issues Nice Display Quality Storage is also really good available at this price  Negetive Points: Not a good battry Camera placed at bottom of the screen
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Ordered this laptop after much research and got it for 61k. Have always used Dell laptops and hence this was the first time I decided to go for a different brand. Following are its pros and cons that I have encountered as of now:  Pros: 1. Looks wise it's quite awesome. You can use it for your office meetings. Even though it's a gaming laptop, looks wise it seems to be quite sleek and professional. The laptop feels premium. 2. Runs all the recent games quite smoothly. 3. Boots up in less than 8 seconds. 4. Built quality is good. 5. Audio quality is good.  Cons: 1. Webcam is very very poor. Though it mentions HD but it's like VGA quality. 2. Sometimes Fan tends to make too much noise. Especially while gaming. 3. It's a little heavy to carry around. 4. Battery tends to drain very fast. 5. Charger cable is somewhat short."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"It's a great laptop for gaming and other stuffs, the only issue is with the battery it has the worst battery backup I have ever seen, in the description it says that it has at least 7 hour or battery backup but even when I don't use it it still drains a lot of power and without gaming it works for 2 hours max with gaming mostly 1 hour also it heats up very quickly"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,It is a nice laptop with good build quality and performance. Good for doing regular work and gaming. After continuous usage also not seeing any heating issues. One major flaw I can see is the webcam located at bottom of the screen. I didn't like that . Otherwise it is a very good gaming laptop for decent price. My purchase price is 59k.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I bought this Laptop for Machine Learning and Deep Learning purpose and not for gaming. It has been 2 weeks since I bought this laptop, And I was actually Very Impressed with the Laptop. There are mainly 2 disadvantages with this laptop, The Battery and the Camera. The camera has been placed below the monitor which makes the video weird when I use it for attending meetings or classes. And the battery Lasts upto 4.5 hours Max. The Monitor and the Keyboard are the best. The Backlit keyboard is very good for programing. Overall very satisfied with this laptop."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Battery back up is worst, just used browser it gives back up of 2-3 hours and camera quality is very poor, its also placed at wrong direction."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Boot time is very good ~8 seconds (with windows loaded on SSD) Applications are loaded fast (Being a developer, the experience is good) (with apps installed on SSD) Above average performance for Machine Learning processing. Gaming experience is good. However, sometimes my GTA V gets little slow as the CPU usage increases - Note that I have McAfee always running on my machine). GPU performance is nice. Camera quality is bad considering the price of laptop(However I am fine with quality for processing with openCV framework) Sound quality is good.  Overall experience is good at this price (I bought at ₹63,500) after using for 1 month."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Product is good as long as you don't update any drivers or try to change any settings. Things will start messing after you update drivers.bkack screen issues and also sudden fps drops during gaming. Better go for amd processor and graphics card and also there is no help from the Lenovo service centre.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I have just bought this product but it is evidently really good product. When you handle it, it becomes wow clear how good it is... So far very happy with the purchase except for the fact that warrantee begins from manufacture date and not customer purchase date."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Amazing, sleek looking product, Bought it for my son who is in college, He is happy with this product, But wanted a laptop bag along with it. Had seen it was bundled with this laptop before. Hope lenevo sends one"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,In just 20 days of buying this laptop keyboard was not working and till date there seems to be no solution as service centre is also nit able to fix this problem
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,This is a great purchase. I got it for 60k and I don't regret getting it at all. The battery life is decent when not gaming. Lasts okay if you're playing games with high settings at which the games run real smooth. Go for it.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Don’t hesitate to buy it online if u get it in the range of 60-63k....I was worried whether the product could be damaged or defective but nahhhh ...products lit ! Do buy it from amazon !
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,The camera is at the bottom of the screen which makes u feel like you looking up while talking with someone over VC. The battery is good enough for 3-4 hours. It's look Aswom.. Do not think twice before this purchase it's a good buy

Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"After 1 month of usage it performs well. Performs modern titles without lag. Battery backup is low as it lacks an igpu,which could be used for other tasks other than gaming. Position of webcam is bad. OVERALL IT'S AN AWESOME RIG."

Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Battery backup is less lasts for four hours only and the performance of the laptop is pretty good. It is heavy durable with a hard body and wide screen to view anything. Except battery everything else is fine.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Awesome laptop. It's very nice as specified.

Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"No packaging by amazon, direct laptop, 2 boys came to deliver it, both looked under age. Very bad. Hanging a lot with minimal use and battery draining quite fast also at minimal use. I would like to return the laptop. Not happy at all by the performance."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"This particular laptop along with the Legion series has a MAJOR flaw in design that causes the charger/charging port to stop working. Several months after I purchased the laptop, my battery stopped working. My laptop would shut down if I removed the adapter. Luckily at that time I still had my warranty, so it was replaced. Then several months later, I had charging issues again. But this time it was working even without the adapter, so it was not the battery. So I bought a new adapter, after it arrived the results were the same. It wasn't working. After some research online, I found out that the charging port was the issue and it was a common case, where the charging port will eventually become loose over time and eventually stop working. Some people report sending back their laptops to Lenovo at least 3 or 4 times to repair for the same issue in the duration of several years.  I don't usually write reviews but felt the urge to save people from the frustrations and loss I had to face.  Please avoid buying this laptop along with other Lenovo Legion laptops. (If you don't trust me, Google 'Lenovo Legion Y540 not charging' and you'll come across dozens of cases facing the same issue)"
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Ran a long 4k video on youtube in chrome and the gpu wasnt able to handle it, the machine froze. must mentioned im using ubuntu with the official nvidia drivers with h/w acceleration enabled. Even with it disabled, there still was 350% cpu usage when i played 4k video on youtube, and the fans kept spinning. Basically the spinning got louder and louder and then chrome just froze, gnome too.  Very heavy too. Worst is, the camera is at the BOTTOM not the top of the monitor. i mean, WHO DOES THAT."

Vivobook-X515MA-EJ001T-Silver-Intel-Celeron,laptop,Its working fine but some lagg in while bootting and opening programs and in my point of view it is suitable only for a minimal usage like online classes and browsing not good for games.
Vivobook-X515MA-EJ001T-Silver-Intel-Celeron,laptop,"This laptop is not for gaming. The camera quality is worst. The display is also not good. This laptop is really very slow . Overall this laptop is good for students This laptop is very heavy , more than 2 kg"
Vivobook-X515MA-EJ001T-Silver-Intel-Celeron,laptop,Budget friendly laptop with fingerprint sensor...value for money

Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Hello guys, this is good laptop no doubt even Amazon delivery is also great. The main issue is with manufacturers itself. Yes my brother bought me this laptop, was working like charm until 14months from purchase. Then I have started facing issue with charging port.  Now that my laptop is out of warranty (order date was 4/10/2019 back then they have offered only 1 year manufacturer warranty) I have emailed to Out_Of_Warranty_Services then said opt for on-site service as your product is out of warranty you have to pay. I said okay and sent my details. You won't get quick replies to your email and they don't even reply to all the queries and questions you have asked.  It is more than a month now still did not get any reply regarding on-site service.  Basically the thing is onsite service is just a scheme, because they have no intention of repairing your device reaching your place once warranty is finished. I've asked for availability of service centers around my city then they said there are no service centers available. Means I must travel to another big metro city pune for getting my laptop checked.  So to summarise; Do not buy lenovo laptops. Not very good after sales service and there are no service centers in many cities so forget about purchasing lenovo if your city don't have one.  Dell, HP, Asus are still best alternatives with good quality products and availablity of service centers in many cities."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Lenovo is very clever. They don't actually mention that they give a 5400rpm hdd which gives longer loading times for games and the vantage software isnt very efficient. This laptop is gonna heat up if ur not using a laptop cooling pad below
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"with in 6 month display stop working colorful lines comes and nothing is visible. Thank God for warranty time. But just after it mic stop working. Because it is new for me i have to buy an external mic. This is not stop here, Just after ending of warranty my mother board stop working. Some component get burned during this i am just open a single tab of chrome browser for my test. Hope this helps you. However if you still wanna get a new one take a long warranty with it."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"Hello Guys, Do not purchased it from Appirio dealer. They are selling renewd products as showing new. I purchased this and getting to much heating issue. I call and visit lenovo service center they told me the cooling fan of your laptop is not original. And after no one listening and registered my complaint. So guys pls check your laptop once and do not purchasd it from this dealer. Also one thing Lenovo official store manager told me to do not purchased laptop from online they sell renewd product."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"This piece of tech would only work fine for a month. Please don't buy this good looking junk if you want a peaceful life with a laptop. Every day there is a software issue, and that too when i keep my system up to date. It stops recognising my usb devices every now and then, stops recognising my second monitor and goes blank if you connect it. Discharges almost immediately when disconnected from the power supply.  Half the time I'm troubleshooting, and no solutions apply. It's just a different type of headache."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"I was a lenovo user before but due to the service and very poor quality build of lenovo, short lifespan,overheating issues i had to switch to other brands, I would strongly suggest you to think wisely before you purchase the laptop because it is your hard earned money."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,"This is the best beast you can get at this price range... Awsome performance... Solid durability... Beautiful graphics... Best ergonomics... Believe me guys i do heavy gaming like COD: Infinite warfare, the witcher3: wild hunt, battlefield 4, NFS: Shift2, The Destiny 3, Warframe, Star Wars: The old republic and all at highest or ultra graphics and for hours and hours at a stretch... Sometimes 8 to 9 hours at a stretch... And it gives me 60 FPS non stop... Without lag or without overheating... I havent even overclocked or undervolted the CPU and it is crisp and fast... Thank you lenovo..."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Price must be around 60k. If it is for 60 k then it will be a beast. Then i will highly recommend this laptop to 10 people and also my friends.if it is of 60-61k then i will purchase 7-8 peices of this for my office staffs. Waiting for the price to go down

So, battery back-up is pretty good, not bad. 5. Great design. 6. Good build quality. 7. Core i5 9300HF - 8GB RAM is pretty sufficient."
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Product was great
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Its a good laptop but battery life is only 1hr 30 min only.. so you gotta keep it plugged in all day long
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,I like this all things are good but if you play heavy games on it like battle field 5 or get too hot around 92 degree celcius the gpu and connecting the charger while playing then overall battery get decreases
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,This is one of the best laptop for developers as well as for gamers. The one thing that it's lagging behind is battery life is not so good depending upon the legion line up..  Otherwise it's a best budget gaming laptop
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,My new laptop already has a Microsoft account registered though the laptop was originally new. I've reset my windows and expect that the laptop I bought is not a used one😅

Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Really good for gaming but battery life is not that good. Rest of the features are top notch. Go for it.
Lenovo-i5-9300HF-39-63cm-Windows-81SY00UBIN,laptop,Well one of the best deals I got for 64k under amazon gaming laptop sale You can't ask for for this. It got everything you need for your needs. Go for this undoubtedly.

Vivobook-X515MA-EJ001T-Silver-Intel-Celeron,laptop,"It’s a very good laptop after all in this price range, very useful and it’s not very fast but it’s fast enough and has a lot of space. It might lag in the starting while setting it up but works smoothly while using. I’m personally using this for online classes, gaming and editing. It works perfectly!! And the most confusing part is that there is a different picture of the keypad in the product images and there’s a slightly different version getting delivered!! Except that, it’s an amazing laptop."
Vivobook-X515MA-EJ001T-Silver-Intel-Celeron,laptop,"As i am viewing reviewers images, found different product images the product images shows with num keyboard and it's different from the product I'm viewing. So I'm not able to judge who's right?"

Acer-Graphics-Keyboard-15-6-inch-A515-56,laptop,"Performance as expected of a Intel Core i5 8th Gen. system. System's full performance is limited by the HDD storage, if you want to utilize its maximum performance it must be upgraded with the M.2 NVME SSD Storage. Just add a 256 GB NVME SSD and transfer the OS to the SSD and it should work like a charm.  I am trying to change this laptop as this one has only one negative point for me, i didn't had any idea that the heat dissipation vent is directed towards lower surface. Limiting it to only hard surfaces, and not on lap or any kind of cloth. If you do, it overheats to the point you are all sweaty over the area. While playing PUBG Lite, systems panel above keyboard got too much heated. viewing angles are not too great and screen has kind of a warmer tone. if heating is not an issue you can go for it."
Acer-Graphics-Keyboard-15-6-inch-A515-56,laptop,"I bought for 42.9k . Great texture, touch and fell of body, u'll never regret reg. Touch pad is good a little bigger is appreciable. Keyboard is ok.

I tried pubg pc lite and was getting 100+ fps at high setting while charger plugged in so it is good for casual gaming. It heats up while playing pubg lite.

Acer-Graphics-Keyboard-15-6-inch-A515-56,laptop,Good value for money. Would have given 5 stars if the laptop had an LED to indicate hard disk activity. Built-in speakers give out a decent volume and sound quality. Windws 10 is better than Windows 8.1 which I had on my previous (HP) laptop. I hope Windows 10 updates do not spoil its performance.

Acer service center support is pathetic my new laptop had keyboard issue and then takes months to change the part so I don't recommend anyone not worth value for money."

Lenovo-i5-1135G7-Touchscreen-Fingerprint-82BH00CTIN,laptop,"Looks, Size, feel are all very good. Performance it is absolutely new now so it is behaving like any new laptop. Weight could have been lighter. Sound quality is not like Yoga500 my earlier laptop of 2015 make but yes much louder. Video sharpness there is enough scope to improve, Yoga 500 was better. Metal body finish is a plus. Overall for work satisfied for hobby more is needed."
Lenovo-i5-1135G7-Touchscreen-Fingerprint-82BH00CTIN,laptop,"This is probably the cheapest Evo certified machine you can get, has good RAM, CPU. Xe works for me as I don't game. It's slim and convertible with a touchscreen and pen. Office 2019 and Home is official licensed which I activated and then went to use my 365/Pro keys, the license activation and swap was a breeze. Nice screen, has Dolby Vision and Atmos. Black levels and back light are satisfactory for an IPS LCD, its good. Battery life is nice, so is the overall finish of the chasis. Toshiba NVMe and Windows 11 ready with TPM 2 criteria meeting.  Overall very happy."

Awesome purchase. Go for it."
Lenovo-i5-1135G7-Touchscreen-Fingerprint-82BH00CTIN,laptop,"The laptop works really well. The best I have used in a while. Easy to work.

Other than that the Fingerprint (""Windows Hello Fingerprint"") and touch works really well."

Lenovo-i5-1135G7-Touchscreen-Fingerprint-82BH00CTIN,laptop,"I bought lenovo yoga 7 series laptop by paying 89k which the company claims to be placed on the premium side of its products, but the product is just pathetic. The external chassis design is made to look good, but the display and the keyboard area design is below average. It has crazy heating issue and the battery backup claimed is an absolute cheat. I own a 6 year old 45k worth lenovo ideapad which is far better in quality than this 88k worth piece of crap. Lenovo stores and customer care are a bunch of frauds, so if you have good budget go for apple and not these Chinese craps."

No one in their company has specific answers, or they dont want to answer. Also beware of battery capacity, other websites say 4 cell battery with 54 whr, while the specs here say 3 cell ‘2.6 whr’ battery.  EDIT: I brought the laptop, this exact model from amazon (D552192WIN9S) i can confirm it has wifi 5 (ac) and a 54 watt hour battery.

Renewed-Latitude-E6430-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Laptop specifications are matching with the product description. keys are working fine. Performance seems good. I intend to use this laptop for my personal technical work.
Renewed-Latitude-E6430-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,The product is too old. its repainted in some parts . so 3 switches and the finger print sensor is not visible properly . one screw is mixing . so for this price its not worthy. the product picture shown is (new one) not matching with real product (Its old one). Not happy with the pricing. somehow its working but the appearance is not satisfying.
Renewed-Latitude-E6430-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,I have used this computer for a month or more. Great for young school going child during lockdown who does not have to move it much. Performs very well for such an old model
Renewed-Latitude-E6430-Integrated-Graphics,laptop,Not worth Rs.27K. Too damaged. Someone must have used it for at least 5 years and returned it.

HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-Graphics-15-ec0106ax,laptop,"I personally am aligned towards HP since I already have another 4 year old laptop which still works as smooth as butter which is why I wanted this brand. Coming to this laptop, I think in this budget around 60-65k this is one of the best laptops with the best features in class, almost same features were available in different brands with price of 72k.  The laptop has a matt finish which gives it a royal look, overall the looks are classy, just the perfect display size.  Performance wise it has been top notch, there has been no issues so far.  This is probably the best choice in this budget, go for it.  Dont forget to vote this review if you found it useful, I'll try to add more descriptive once I use this for a month or so."

Right Now I have to use a Bluetooth headset if i want to watch movies or youtube videos without disturbing others . Except for that everything was perfect for this laptop. Its good for casual gaming like GTA V, CS Go etc."

I have called hp customer service and talked to the agent but they were not able to help either. The apps don't appear on the taskbar after starting the laptop, it takes them more than a minute to come. And the audio also stops anytime. And when the last time I tried opening it, the system said the pin is not working and told me to install a app for the same.

After 5 days of usage my observation goes like the below: 1. The ideal price for this laptop should be somewhere 40-45k even though HP is providing windows 11, 8GB RAM & 1TB HD 2. Built quality is not so good. You don't find the premiumness while using. 3. No backlight for keyboard and I feel few keys are hard ex. ESC button & Power button 4. Display quality is OKAY. 5. Camera quality is pathetic. 6. While charging the laptop you will hear fan sound which is too noisy. 7. Charging port does not fit properly and you can see the image.  Hear me out! Don't make the mistake which I did. Never buy HP laptops. It is a sub standard product."

Also the internet browser is damn slow and takes life to open new tabs. Even my old DELL laptop that I had been using for last 10 yrs works faster than this HP Laptop. Battery backup is also very less of only 1.5 hrs.  Very disappointed with Amazon too. I didn't get the opportunity to use the laptop earlier. When I used it after 10 days of delivery, I encountered the problems. Just because my return window had expired by 3 days, Amazon intimated that all their responsibilities had ceased.  I feel I have been looted off my hard earned money.  DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP."

Charging also taking long time more than 3hrs with given 65watt charger. 3. Power or Charging indicators(light) are at sides of laptop, not knowing whether laptop is charging or switch on. You have to strech yourself to side and need to see. 3. All ports are at one side. Inconvinent to insert charger pin, mouse usb and pendrive at a time. 4. Not able to open screen more than 110 degrees. 5.Not able to charge with USB TYPE C port, need to charge with only pin.  Pros 1. Screen clarity is good, with brightness and colors.Almost same as tabs and mobile screens clarity. 2.quick reboot , taking 5 to 10 seconds to login or logoff. 3. Processor and RAM are efficient, able to work smoothly. 4. Speaker sound is decent , getting good voice clarity while listing calls or youtube viedos."
HP-39-62cms-i5-1135G7-Integrated-15s-du3032TU,laptop,"The laptop is good. Have been using it for a day and things work as expected. Purchased it for 55k. Unfortunately I had a bad experience with the seller for this item. I don't think anyone properly checks what he is dispatching. The laptop that arrived was already used. Packing of latop and charger were all over the place. Dirty fingerprints all over the laptop. Switched the laptop ON and it said no Operating system installed, which was kind of funny. So it was basically a paperweight worth 55k. Amazon team was hepful to arrange a replacement. But the seller took his own sweet time of like 8-10 days to deliver the replacement laptop. And this is inspire of me being a Amazon Prime customer. In today's times, sitting without a working laptop is akin to doing nothing. So yes, had a lot of mental. Tension and pressure while the laptop was arriving. I had a not so good experience with the seller."

HP-39-62cms-i5-1135G7-Integrated-15s-du3032TU,laptop,"I bought this product from amazon last week. And right from day 1, despite being I5 and 11th gen laptop, it is very slow. It takes a long time even to start and close to 8-10 minutes to stablise the features. I raised a replace request from amazon and they automatically redirected me to mandatory inspection, for which i had to take the leave from my work. And then despite the technician report of faulty laptop, amazon had updated issue resolved in their portal and without informing they closed the issue. When i enquire the status on 17.08 21, which was showing the last day for replacement, they were saying that technician filed issue resolved report with them. and when i requested return the product and refund they refused to do saying the policies are not allowing them to do so. Fortunately i had taken a copy of inspection report from the technician, and amazon asked me for the copy to initiate the replace product. Now since they are not willing to return the product i have no choice but to either use the same faulty equipment or to take a legal route. Never expected this fraud from amazon."
HP-39-62cms-i5-1135G7-Integrated-15s-du3032TU,laptop,Worest product from HP. It's very slow and now it's stopped working. I purchased this 2 weeks back and now it's not working. Please dont buy this product and don't waste your money.
HP-39-62cms-i5-1135G7-Integrated-15s-du3032TU,laptop,Super Bad Graphics!!!!!!!!! It's only 3 days old right now and already RAM is 70% used
HP-39-62cms-i5-1135G7-Integrated-15s-du3032TU,laptop,Speed in great due to SSD. Sleek and light weight. Packing: The hp package was great. Amazon only added a cartoon around it without any safety material. Note: This laptop only have 512 GB SSD without any additional HDD.
HP-39-62cms-i5-1135G7-Integrated-15s-du3032TU,laptop,"In three weeks of usage, observed: Positive: Antireflective screen is amazing. Battery runs longer 7-8hrs. Negative: Booting speed is very low, the system hangs a lot, BIOS got corrupted and now doesn't start at all. HP Service centres are worst; they delay diagnosing the product when on warranty.  No backlit keyboard, and the Silver color makes it difficult to read the letters on keyboard in broad daylight.  I am stuck with this stupid laptop, and now I have no option to return or replace the product.  In a nutshell, configuration is fine but lack of SSD make it slow; better get the one with SSD."
HP-39-62cms-i5-1135G7-Integrated-15s-du3032TU,laptop,"Laptop is not working after 7 days of installation i.e from 18th June 2021, called amazon customer care centre, told to call HP, called HP customer care centre , told to call microsoft, called microsoft no help provided yet, laptop is still not working.

But after using it for a couple of days i am totally disappointed with the product. It doesn't seem to be like a i5 processor with 8 gb ram. It's extremely slow, even during it's first start which made me worry a lot, My old laptop acer which I bought seven years back is even faster than the new one . The battery backup is also not too good. Backup is only for 3 hours in normal use (word or excel using). Quite happy with the delivery it was too fast. But not so happy with the product😢"

Vivobook-X515MA-EJ101T-PQC-N5030-TRANSPARENT-International,laptop,"Waste of money. Not even 25 days old and the screen has stopped working.. this is ridiculous. Have to take the laptop to a service center as amazon won't do a thing about it Edit - 2 hours later laptop is fully dead, asus is promising to help since 9 days - IT IS STILL NOT REPAIRED, ONLY EXCUSES FROM ASUS AND AMAZON  Asus has the worst products and no proper service post sales."

HP-Laptop-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2015TU,laptop,"Dislike the product, screen height is very less compare to other brand laptop, very much handle with care item. Not suitable for every day use and also not suitable for kids online class.

HP-Laptop-14-inch-Windows-14s-dr2015TU,laptop,"got it replaced within 2 days due to hardware issues (both screen and mouse pad stopped working).. was not fortunate the second time as the wifi issues started to come post the 7 days replacement guarantee. now with HP customer care not able to solve the issue related to slow speed and intermitted disconnection.. not surprising giving me lame excuses like ""it's an ISP isssue"" and / or it's a ""frequency"" issue. trying all the jargons they can without realizing that not everyone can be taken for a ride..with issues happening even in the replaced laptop there's no doubt that the quality check and/or material used is sub standard !! now left to the mercy of HP guys to help me out.. hardly any hope though !!"

Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,Dont buy as battery life is worst and screen not that much good and a bit heavy and not a value for money
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Ryzen 5 5500U is the best chipset you can find in the mid-range laptops which even gives a run for the money to Core i7 processors that being said major cons I found were -  Pros - 1. Ryzen 5 5500U (no lag what so ever even with 8 GB ram) 2. Upgradable RAM to additional 16GB in the one slot which is empty (8GB onboard is soldered to the mother board) 3. Additional slot for 2.5 HDD/SDD 4. 300 nits decent display 5. WiFi 6 (works like a charm with my 100 mbps wifi) & Gigabit ethernet port 6. Light weight (under 1.8kg for a 15.6inch laptop) 7. Good laptop for techies - Linux Support (I have tested Garuda Linux *Arch based distro) works well for most parts, bluetooth and webcam have some issue which needs to be fixed but otherwise works smooth (these issues may not be there with Ubuntu/Debian, haven't tested it yet) 8. Battery life is decent expect around 5-6 hours of backup with light usage.  Edit: Bluetooth and Webcam issue fixed by using 5.10.40-1-lts kernel in arch/Garuda linux  Cons - 1. Built in speakers sound low for my liking  Highly recommend this laptop for power users (techies/programmers). I haven't tested any games as of yet as I work mostly with Linux. Light gaming should be fine better than Intel onboard graphics for sure!."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"I was eyeing for this laptop since its announcement.  Earlier I was using a i5 6th gen processor laptop which was slow comparing to this....  The machine highlights after using it for a month, Very neat and simple design, No heating issue.  1. The performance is great and snappy. 2. The battery life is 4-6 hours at normal usage. 3. Boot time is around <10 seconds. 4. The build quality is normal but loved the Aluminum top cover. 5. The look is quite simple and professional. 6. The screen quality is FHD, great for the price. 7. I loved the Backlit Keyboard 8. WiFi connectivity is great with AX Technology. 9. Sound - Good, use headphone is you are a music lover :-P 10. Overall it's a great laptop for the price.  RAM, HDD & SSD can be upgraded...  4 Star only because of Poor Support from ACER..."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,Best laptop
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"I found this Laptop on ACER and Croma site at night for 53K and 52K. Being sleepy, I left it and next morning it was out of stock on both. Then I bought it on Amazon for 56K less 1K discount for HDFC card. I have my old laptop ACER Aspire V3-471G with Core-i7 3630QM processor. I used it for 9 years and it is still working. This one is a bigger beast.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 5 5500U is better than most Core i7 CPUs. 2. Upgradable RAM to additional 16GB in the one slot which is empty (8GB onboard is soldered to the mother board) 3. Additional slot for 2.5 HDD/SDD 4. Anti glare full HD good display 5. WiFi 6 works smoothly 6. Light weight (under 1.8kg for a 15.6inch laptop) 7. Good laptop for techies - Linux Support (I have installed Linux Mint XFCE.) Everything was detected and works well. There is only one issue, which I am not sure whether it's an issue- Display works at 77 hzs 8. Battery life is decent expect around 5-6 hours of backup with light usage. 9. I am using Windows 10 in Virtualbox under Linux Mint Host. That requires multiple CPU cores. My old Laptop would become hot upto 87'C with two OSs running in it. This one is a real beast. Temperature rarely crosses 50' C even in summer. 10. A Hard disk caddy is supplied along with the laptop for installing second HDD or SSD. I went to nearby ACER support center for installing additional 1TB SSD and 8GB RAM. It took only 10 minutes at reasonable charges. Great value for money 55k  Cons - 1. Built in speakers sound is lower than average."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Everything's great in this machine. Boots within 10 sec. To the main home screen. It's fast and snappy.. The only flaw is the screen bleeding. You can check in the attached image when dark wallpaper was applied and under full dark room. Picture was taken. Nothing serious. In normal use anyone won't notice just in case if you are in dark room there may be chances it may be visible. Talking about the ""sound quality"". It is quite loud in my case I didn't feel like loudness is less. It's good. Display colors are good but can be tweaked in Radeon app settings."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,Good laptop overall
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Excellent battery life, decent screen with IPS so good viewing angles, Lightweight aluminium top body, boots up and shuts down in seconds because of 8GB RAM and 512 GB SSD. AMD Radeon Graphics does the job well, can play light games. Soft and brisk touchpad. Overall a good package in the price."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,just you look this laptop every things has been provide most important is that acer service centre. Today I have visited with my laptop to install external HDD. what a service just took 5 minutes. Manager Jogesh has tolled me due pandemic I am ready to send my technical staff in my resident. What more you want. Another best quality service of Amazon they have give me this ACER ASPIRE AMD RYZEN 5-5500U laptop within 04 days. Amazon hats off You. Its looks too Good and best keyboard minor sound supposed to be high. Otherwise every parts & function are too excellent. ACER Wishing you all the best . I was purchased first laptop on 2007 it was Acer next two are HP now again I purchased ACER.
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Used it for a week and....  Good battery life, lasts around 8 hrs with wifi on, bluetooth off, screen at 50 percent brightness n doing medium tasks  Average speakers n webcam, should have been better at this price point  Average screen, it is ips but colours arent accurate enough, brightness is adequate and the antiglare type helps too  Good performance through the ryzen 5500u, that's the highlight here No heating issues as such  Good design n build quality even though half of it is plastic Backlit keyboard is good with decent key travel and it can be turned off during daytime to save some battery, typing on it feels nice for a laptop  Comes with an extra hdd mounting slot, pre installed windows and ms office  Overall 4/5, was in need of a laptop so bought it at 60k without waiting for discounts, but anywhere below 55k its a good deal for sure"
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"We had purchased for our son and he just loved using the laptop for everyday use, Coding, watching videos, attending webinars and attending his classes online. The battery backup is amazing and the Laptop overall is just awesome. No issues as of now connecting to Wifi 2.5 ghz/ 5 ghz band. Since we have Airtel broadband the Wifi autoconnects to highest 5 ghz band and is super fast. Laptop opens up super fast and depends on if we have configured any login password or personalised photos/background during Laptop login page, based on which little difference may be seen but overall great processor for faster access to anything to be done with this laptop. Not has an opportunity to contact ACER for any issue as Laptop is working great. Thank You."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,I love all over design of laptop thin and lightweight and performance of this laptop is unbelievable its full fill my all requirements but price range higher because when we see on acer official website price are low and always show out of stock over all acer doing very well in term of body we got aluminum top and backlit keyboard
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Value for money. lightweight Laptop. Powerful Processor. Display Quality is amazing.
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  Product is awesome, light weight and looks very good specially in reallife Display is awesome and due to its IPS panel viewing angles are also great. Battery backup under battery saver mode is around 10-11 hours and on medium power it's 7 hours approx and while using its full potential is best performance mode battery is around 4.5 hours approx. Boot time is just incredible within 3-4 sec max maybe due to only SSD installed in it however you can install extra hdd upto 2tb but in my opinion don't go for hdd it will put some extra load on booting and it might take time like 6-7 sec after installing hdd as I do have hp pavillion gaming series Ryzen 4600H but it has hybrid disk 256gb SSD + 1tb hdd and its Boot time is around 7-8 sec that is why don't install hdd in rather go for 2.5 inch SSD of sata. Trackpad might look small in pics but in real life it is more then enough. Keyboard is good, no need to upgrade Ram 8 gb is more then enough."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,Good product 👍 but remember graphic card is only of 512 mb here so choose wisely with others
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Everything is awesome good for students and little gaming and it has and issue i face when i was updated the update ,The battery percentage from 100% it went to 25% in half an hour and the speakers are shit better get a pair of earphone"
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Good Battery life, snappy performance (any time I had minimum 15 chrome tabs open along with 3-4 other apps. No lag."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Great laptop with very high quality screen,the battery life is around 7 hrs and the trackpad is just excellent"
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,Good value for money. There’s only one s drawback - the speakers are not loud enough.
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,Speaker and camera quality is so cheap Not recommended for online classes and kids Difficulty in returning it Cheap product Never do shop with amazon

Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Great product,fully satisfied"
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Amazing display, good battery backup"
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,Good
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"The 5500U is, to slightly put it, ABSOLUTELY BONKERS, Gives even the Current Generation i7s, (dare I say i9s) a run for their money. Compiles the entire Linux kernel in under a minute (If you don't know what that means, let me tell you its Performance is Beyond Comprehension)  Cooling is quite awesome, albeit borrowed from ROG machines (That's a Good Sign too), it definitely shows ingenuity.  The iGPU isn't as powerful as DGPUs but that's obvious, Not bad.  RAM? 8 Gigs which is good enough for most people, but if you aren't one of them, You can expand upto 24 Gigs (IMO 16GB is Good Enough for me so I stuck with that) Basically, overkill for the target demographic and if you want even more, I think 60K isn't the price range you should be looking at.  Gaming - Haven't tested much gaming on this though, just some Rainbow Six: Siege, Halo 3, Far Cry 3 and MW3 all running on KVM on Manjaro Linux (Tux reigns supreme), except for Siege, which I had to run using dual boot because of BattlEye's KVM Restrictions (Those Pricks). Performance for all of them is acceptable seeing that they are in fact running on iGPUs.  Programming - As stated above it compiles the entire linux kernel in under a minute so compilation tasks won't suffer (Tested on gcc, ghc, elixirc, javac, nasm+ld and rustc). As for parsing goes, it shines there as well 4 Ghz is more than enough to run any interpreted application and 12 threads are enough to handle any async task (Tested on NodeJS, Python 3.9, leiningen, racket and haxe running in interpreted mode). Ran Multiple CLion, IntelliJ Idea and Webstorm Instances without it breaking a sweat, even with a Kjillion Daemons like PgSQL, Dgraph, MySQL, Docker (7 Containers!), and a local Kubernetes Cluster (3 Containers)  An eloquent machine for anyone who can appreciate its elegance, Programmers, Techies, Gamers, all alike"
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"Merits 1. Battery life lasts once charged almost a day and half on economical use.  2. Weight- Medium weight, does not feel like burden on shoulder or in hands.  3. Processor- Powerful enough to work swiftly.  4. RAM- Expansion limit to 24GB. Upgraded  5. Silver Colour- Makes feel premium  6. Integrity - Non flexible. Damage proof from certain height.  Demerits 1. MS Office- Not activated. (Should have been)  2. Expandable memory- Slot should have atleast 1TB HDD  3. Backlight Keyboard - Has no dimmer. Too much brightness in dark room.  4. No fingerprint scanner.  Conclusion - Perfect for the multiple works. Could have been feature-rich in this range but lacks.  Advisable to buy."
Acer-Aspire-Ryzen-5500U-Processor,laptop,"I am sharing this review after purchasing laptop from local shop where I get best deal.. here are some genuine reason why you with pros and cons.., Pros--- 1. Full Hd screen with ips display it's very looking great. 2. AMD rzyn 5 -5500 Au beats processor. 3. Camera quality decent but not above average as compare to other high priced laptop, works good. 4. Backlit keyboard and very good Mouse pad work good in gesture also. 5. Build quality was good as compared to HP and dell , having metal on top and premium plastic on keyboard. 6. Less booting time less than 5 sec to start and same time to shut down, thanks for SSD and 8 GB ram. 7. Looks professional and attractive. 8. Battery back us is good after I used 4 hours on single charges still 45 % battery is remaining and charging time is 2 hours so it will also a good for heavy users.  Cons - 1. Speaker is very poor in terms of listening songs or watching movie it's should be great if having powerfull spkr or take a Bluetooth speaker for this things with add on. 2. Don't have finger prints reader where in this price Acer should add FPS.  I found only this cons rest overall laptop is quite premuim also give super speed not lag at all I can do a bit of video editing and gaming also but yes only speaker is very low interns of other laptop rest is very good laptop under 58k...  If u are looking for beast laptop than go for it believe me u don't regret but onl thing is that take a Bluetooth speaker for enternating purpose of u user somewhere....thanks I hope this will help u.."
Lenovo-14-inch-Laptop-Windows-81YA002GIH,laptop,battery back up not up to the mark. 2- 2.5 hrs max.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"Ordered this based on immense research. Certainly one of the best options available in this price (~₹60K). I ordered 2, however the second one was defective, ordered a replacement again, got another defective product. Returned it, ordered a seperate model with 120Hz, received defective charger. Pissed me off. This issue arrised despite Amazon assuring me they will quality check my replacement product.  Anyway, the laptop itself, I've bought 2 of. 1 from Amazon and 1 offline from Lenovo (got it cheaper there too) and it's genuinely good. So if you're seeing the reviews to find whether this is a good laptop, YES. It is! I use it for Video Editing and Programming. Programming is tough with just 8GB RAM, I might upgrade that. But the CPU performance I get is great. Not a gamer, so can't speak for that. But Nvidia's 1650 has a fantastic reputation with games, so you need not worry.  Buy this laptop over the Legion, TUF and Nitro. It's better overall. As for this seller, make sure you're thoroughly checking your product in the return period. I've had issues more than twice.  If you've read this far, mark this comment as 'Helpful' so other people see it too. Good luck."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"This is going to be long. So lets go with pros and cons. Pros: Build and Keyboard: I was surprised to see the build was so sturdy given the fact that it's plastic. Coming to the keyboard it is one of the best I've ever used. The blue backlit is looks great(would've preferred for an RGB though).  Thermals and Fans :The thermals were quite good for a laptop around 60k and the fan sound was barely audible even in performance mode.The laptop does get heated while playing AAA games but nothing much to be worried about.  Performance: The AMD Ryzen 5 core works like a charm, it gives intel i7 10th gen a run for its money.The boot up time is around 4-6 sec with the SSD.All the FPS games ran pretty smoothly even with ultra settings.  Others: The Lenovo Vantage software is a plus and so is the privacy shutter(which I think every laptop should have by the way)  Cons: Display: Nothing great to be excited about here. Both the brightness and color accuracy of the screen are average.  Battery: Okay so I see Lenovo changed their stance on battery life from 6.7 hrs to 5 which is more accurate . While gaming the battery lasted for about 90 min.During normal usage it lasts for 3.5 - 4 hrs, although it did last for 5 hrs when the settings were under Quiet mode.  Speakers: The speakers were okay and I expected nothing more from a laptop of this price range(I mostly use headphones anyway).  So to conclude this just might be one of the best gaming laptop under 65k if not the best and you could totally go for it."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"First of all, an epic laptop. Comes with all specs i require. I am not so much into gaming and the processor is fabulous. Comes with a superb quality display and a cool looking blue backlight. Its fast af🔥. It runs like butter. Overall not so much for gaming. If you're considering for gaming, you should go with the 1660ti version. But met my requirements.  A bit cons - -The body is a magnet to fingerprints, need to regularly clean with a cloth. -Weight is a bit more -60 hertz only if you're here for gaming. For me this is no issue.  Conclusion- You should definitely consider buying, I didn't trust Lenovo lately but its value for money 👍"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"First I appreciate the delivery by Amazon as promised timeline even during this covid situation.  Below is my Lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 config, AMD Ryzen 5 4600h, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram, 120HZ, Nvidia GTX 1650. Model.no: 82EY00UAIN  1. Full HD display is really good at this price. 2. Build quality is good and the structure is simply the best. 3. Keypad, trackpad and backlight are very nice. 4. The laptop boots up with in 5 sec, it's awesome.  Everything is perfect except the below 2 items, 1. Battery is draining little faster for normal usuage itself. 2. Audio speaker is not as good as expected.  In a nutshell I would say this is a very good budget gaming laptop if you are looking around 60k."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,Above expectations.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"Just got it about 10 days ago. So can't give a proper review as such. So this is not a long term usage review. Pros: -Consistently string performance -No heating at all -Good anti glare -Not as heavy as i thought it would be Build though plastic, is quite sturdy. If don't believe that metal is always the best solution. Considering the weight, kind of laptop etc. -Amazing keyboard. It's well thought out and has a good feel, and didn't experience any flexing. -Keyboard with 2 levels of back light. Make it clear in the darkest of environments.  Cons: Not many -Average battery life. -Color accuracy of the screen is poor. It's fine for someone like me but do consider this when buying -Web cam is below average."

I am sharing my 10 days experiance with this system.  1.BULID QUALITY: Screen side body is bulid by somekind of Fiber which is very stiff and the lower body is bulid by plastic but it feels like a premium. Laptop design is ultimate.For Bulid quality and design it can get 5/5 definitly.  2. CAMERA: One grate thing about camera is they give Privacy shutter feature through which u can lock your camera. A good camera security feature.Camera quality is not good.It's worst. It gives too much pixalated images.You can record video upto 720p 30fps. It is better to purchase external camera if you are a creator/Live streamer.  3. KEYBOARD: It is full size keyboard. Key design and the quality is awesome. This keyboard design wil helps to comfort and accurate typing. Key movement is also good. It has two modes of backlight(BLUE color). The blue colored key light feels like premium. One important thing is, You should always take care(clean) of keybord, Any dust and stones kind of small particles will easely enter below the keys and may cause problems when typing. Always clean keyboard before using it.  4. BATTERY: Battery life is decent. For me It gives almost 6hrs to 6.5hrs in 'bettter performance' mode where I done coding and MS word kind of things which doesn't need much CPU power.  5. DISPLAY: 15.6"" 120Hz Full HD IPS anti-glare display gives Very smooth video experiance. Plays 4k videos well. Viewing angle is also good.  6.AUDIO QUALITY: It comes with Dolby Atmos Stereo speaker. Sound is loud and clear(i don't felt any kind of noise from the speakers). It is more than enough.  7. STORAGE: It comes with 512GB SSD.There is a dedicated HDD slot,We can insert 1 TB of HDD along with this 512GB SSD there.  8. PERFORMANCE: I have not tested any game,it may works fine. Gives awesome performance for office work and multitasking. If video editing concerned, Try to buy 16GB RAM varient or upgrade this system to 16GB, So that you can get better performance(working fine in 8GB also).  CONCLUSION: Under 60-63k,It's realy worth and value for money.Best video and audio experiance, grate performance."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"for the price , it delivers quality performance. Worth buying!"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,It's a fantastic beast man. Just go for it. Best value for money. One of the best in this price range. Before buying I just worried about Lenovo' s build quality. But in this case Lenovo proven me wrong. The build quality is good and gives premium look. Hardware wise there is nothing new to say. But the package is good for this price range. Battery life is good while playing movies/ streaming online can run till 4 to 5 hours. While programming it can hold upto 3 to 4 hrs. I didn't tried on gaming. However this is ok for the given hardware.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"Yes, you read the headline right. If any of that is not your priority, you may go ahead with the laptop. It's a good laptop, don't get me wrong, but  1. if you're expecting the advertised battery performance, then you will be disappointed - immensely. I get at most an hour, which to my requirement is good enough. I always look for power source nearby, and if there is none, I try to limit my electronic (phone, laptops etc) usage. It's all right with me, but maybe not with you.  2. if you're expecting a ""premium"" support, as advertised, then you will be disappointed again. Exactly the day AFTER my return window with Amazon ended, I found out that the number 5 on the right-side number pad gets stuck. ONE day! A conglomerate like Amazon should be in a place to make exceptions, but it's all right, I was still within Lenovo's warranty, and because of that, I was asked by the Amazon representative to contact them - and I did. By bad support, I am not talking about the support I got from Amazon - this guy was just following standard protocol - it's Lenovo's! The same day, I raised a ticket with them, and it's been a week now, and I haven't gotten ANY call/email/message from them. Now I hear you ask, ""But doood. If you haven't gotten any email or message, the complaint wouldn't have gone through or registered"", to which I say, I see the ticket number when I go to the Lenovo portal, and it's in ""Investigating"" status (or something like that). You get the point. ONE WEEK of premium support (or lack thereof)!  **UPDATE** - Lenovo finally acknowledged the request and some 8 - 9 tos-and-fros later, agreed to send a technician, who found out the issue is real and agreed for a replacement (Obviously it wasn't all this simple - this whole process took him about 2 hours). FYI, as on this writing, the replacement is yet to arrive (and the laptop is sealed in a Lenovo branded cover with its carton box - post Covid-19 procedure I suppose - and is in my custody). And that's 2 days without laptop- Just saying :/  3. if you expect to play a lot of newer games - I haven't tried this personally, and I bought this laptop not (entirely) for gaming (although I had installed CoD Ghosts (I know it's an old game), and after like an hour into the game, it glitched on me once - at a place when there was a huge explosion, maybe the graphics card couldn't process that much info) but I must say it's been a good performer. I ran my DL (deep learning) model with over 1 crore rows, and about 17 columns and it performed better than my work laptop, which has (only) a 16 gb RAM, no external graphic card. I will upgrade the RAM on this to 16 (it's 8*1 now and I will add another equivalent 8 (3200/CL-22)) and see how it goes, but all that after I get the issue at hand sorted out.  BTW, the reason I realized my keyboard had an issue late was because I use a Bluetooth keyboard and the only time I used its own keyboard was in its first day, and somehow I forgot to test the keyboard.  FYI, it's a fingerprint magnet."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"REVIEW AFTER 10 DAYS OF USE I have been using this for last 10 days and this was awesome...got this after 2 days of order.  PACKAGE: the packaging were good and they used some decent foam for support.  BUILD QUALITY: the build quality was qutie good for this price range..it feels light enough for a gaming laptop..  KEYBOARD/TRACKPAD: i really loved the keyboard and i really had good typing experience...for the trackpad it was good...and i mostly use external mouse...but the trackpad was fine..  DISPLAY: the one downside is the display...i wont say it is the worst...but could be better... if u want to get better colour quality u can get a external monitor or get another system...but in this price range it is quite common..  SPECS: for the specs its awesome...for around 60k u get a 6 core cpu 4600h wi=hich is amazing in long run.. it has a dedicated gpu 1650 which is awesome.. the ram is acceptable...quite common in this range...but can be easily upgraded to 16gb by adding a single 8gb stick.. the m.2 ssd is nice gives a read speed of around 1700 which is awesome for laptops in this range.. and also u can add additional hdd..i added a 512gb hdd and it works fine..  PERFORMANCE: I installed premiere pro and photoshop and it was working perfect....i didnt overclock the system but i know it will do really good.. i didnt try any games till now but will update in future but i am sure this can run most games in medium/high settings and get 60fps..  TEMPS: for the temps it stays quite and in control while doing programming but can get little hot while doing some serious editing which is quite common..as it takes lots of cpu and gpu usage..  OVERALL: i would definitely recommend this laptop. if u want a laptop for programming,editting,gaming this is the best choice for this price range... battery is average can get some 4hrs avg while using vs code and chrome...and 2-3 hours during editting.. i would reccomend to upgrade the ram as soon as possible to get more perfomance outtaa this..  if u want to get a more of a gaming laptop this is a OK choice as it has only 1650 and the display can hit u if u want good color precision...which can surely be eliminated by getting a good external display...  i would give it a 8/10(as i didnt try any games on this deivce)  will be updating more details after trying out new games and apps..  make sure to give a thumbs up if u think this review helped u so that others can benefit from this thanks :)"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"Still not used that much. I love the keyboard layout and key spacing, display is ok for development and gaming. Loudspeaker sound quality and voice clarity for skype calls is ok. By default almost 40 - 50% of RAM is used, bu i didn't affect the performance. Better to go with additional 8 GB for gaming"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,Well I was using an old laptop it was sooo slowwwww.It hardly give 30 fps in cs go at low settings but this laptop can easily give you around 116 to 180 fps in the gameplay And all others AAA title games works great. Well no laptop have great colour accuracy So for games I use my lg bx oled tv.Well this GTX 1650 can do games in 1080 p ultra with avg fps of 120 and 1440 p at ultra with avg fps for 80.This can change for some graphics demanding to anes but I can sure you you can play all those games at 1080 p at 60 fps. Well the GTX series GPU doesn't have rt core soo it can't support ray tracing but it doesn't matter if you are planning to play games on the laptop screen.If you are planning to play games on your 4k TV then one can buy ps 5.Anyway if you are planning to use this for your primary gaming then go for the laptop have RTX series GPU or you can buy ps 5 just like I am going to do for gaming purpose.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"No issues with respect to build quality.  There is not much gap for air circulation this causes Cpu temps to cross 80 while gaming, but no thermal throttling observed.  If you lift the laptop using laptop stand temps drop significantly. Also limiting fps to 60 reduces load on GPU and cpu and reduce temps.  Fans are very silent for non gaming use. I have not tested battery yet.  Charger is big and heavy. Not ideal for travellers.  I have installed windows 11 beta, it has TPM."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,Performance seamless. Display amazing.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"Its nice. Before you can buy it, there are couple of things you should remember. 1. Its very heavy, it may not seem a big deal, but it will be soon enough. 2. The plastic body seems vulnerable,so you may want to get ADP from lenovo 3. I get around 5 hrs battery life with power saver and other battery savings methods. Other than these, i am satisfied with this purchase"

Not so good for content creator as it has 3GHz to 4GHz clock speed.  Thermal: charging site is hot, but other sites are cold.  The battery life lasts for 1.5 to 2 hours while playing gaming. Best Gaming Experience.  Battery life up to 5 hours for normal multitasking.  camera is nothing special.  Display is good. Keyboard is very good. The designs give a slightly premium look."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"Ryzen 5 4600h with gtx1650 under 62k is great. Keyboard looks nice with blue backlit. Haven't tried any AAA games but played some low end games, no issues there. There is a little bit of heating at the bottom panel of screen, because of the vent provided, not too much to be worried about. Battery backup is average while gaming (lasts upto 50-70 min). On normal usage can last upto 3-3.5 hrs. nvme ssd is really fast, system boots up within 6 sec. Overall a good laptop considering the price segment and is worth buying."

Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,The laptop is totally value for money. The build quality and keyboard are some of the main difference in comparison to same range laptops. Without high ram usage it can easily last above 6 hrs of battery life. It's a beast in its price range.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,Laptop's trackpad stopped working after 10 days and camera was defective. Since Amazon gives only 7 days. The return window waa closed for me. So contacted lenovo care and they sent parts and technician. He fixed it and now all smooth and nice. It's comes with damage warranty too plus you get premium Lenovo care for 1 year by default. Don't think tok much go for it.

Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"Affordable Laptop for Casual gaming but buy at own risk.. read both pros and cons before buying Lenovo laptops. I brought laptop in this series from Lenovo webstore since it had better deal on EMI, Extended warranty and ADP.  Pros: 1) One of the best Processor and Graphic card combo available currently in India 2) 8GB DDR4-3200 Ram with Dual Channel Support with one empty slot for expansion (16GB is must for multitasking) 3) Superfast boot with 512GB Intel SSD (2280) and option for additional HDD. (go with 1TB HDD if you are on budget, SSD doesn't make game run any faster, I tried myself. only loading time is shorter in SSD) 4) 120Hz display (not this model, but in this series options are there check Lenovo website)  Cons: 1) USB-C Port malfunctioned within 10 days. all USB ports are still working properly in my 10 year old Sony Laptop. Lenovo hardware qty is shit.. 2) Only 2 USB-A port + 1 USB-C port. my 7years old much cheaper Samsung Laptop had 2 USB3 & 2 USB2 ports + SD card reader also one CD driver. Pure cost cutting by Lenovo. 3) Keyboard has only one color led with 2 brightness options. but Blue light looks good. 4) Addition SSD slot only supports 2242mm SSD. or you can remove HDD bay and make space for 2280mm SSD. 5) 250nits brightness is not that good for outdoor use"
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,best machine from Lenovo i bought it for 62500 from lenovo store viman nagar pune. don't buy from Amazon it selling so high.
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,This is a beast🔥🔥🔥 processor- If you compare ryzen 5 4600h it is beteer than 1165g7 i7 processor. And also stands out the same. It boots in about 6 seconds Build quality - okay for the price point Battery -4-5hrs avg charging is also fast Ram-it runs 70percent on just running chrome so I will prefer upgrading to 16gb in future  Thermals-amazing Weight-the laptops weight feels okay it is just overhyped that gaming laptops are not handy Webcam-could have been better Dispay-seems okay Trackpad- THIS IS THE ONLY FLAW IN THIS LAPTOP. It's not that great. After just 4-5 days of use it makes some sounds on pressing. Which is not usual Overall gr8 in this price point. Best for programming Yeah I am now noticing some snappyness in performance after 5 days of usage. Maybe it may increase in future
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,Bought this from lenovo store. It's good for casual gaming. Also buy it in as low as 59.8k from lenovo store
Lenovo-IdeaPad-39-62cms-Graphics-82EY00L9IN,laptop,"I bought the 1TB + 256GB SSD model from Flipkart for 63kand I've only been using this machine for the last 5 days, so it's really a first impression review. Let's divide this into 2 segments,  PROS:  1. Performance - TBH I was using a pretty mediocre laptop before switching to this, but it blew up my mind when I started using it. R5 4600H destroyed my expectations and I am yet to push it to its limits despite editing a couple of 1080p videos while having several bg tasks.  2. Thermals: It does get warm while pushing the GPU to its limits, but it's pretty understandable and really not uncomfortable to work with. I'll keep it as a PRO since I didn't experience any thermal throttling and it didn't turn into a heater.  3. Display: Even though it is only a 45% NTSC and 67% sRGB panel, but I like the colour reproduction, though not accurate and the 120Hz Refresh Rate is a cherry on top for the gamers.  4. Build Quality and Keyboard: I was sceptical about the build quality while ordering the laptop but it is very sturdy. It passes the one-finger lid test with flying colours. There's little to no flex on the keyboard deck as well as the lid. The keyboard is also great to type, it is backlit and the arrow keys are full-sized and are a bit separated, so it might take you a couple of hours to get used to it.  CONS: I am not really disappointed in anything as of yet but if I had to nitpick, speakers are pretty average, not bad but nothing special either, plus the battery life is around 5 hours while using the QUITE MODE for the thermals, which is decent for a gaming laptop but it might be a bummer for some.  MISC: It has an extra RAM slot, the RAM installed is an 8GB DDR4 SODIMM one with a freq of 3200Hz. Even though it is not advised, I installed a 2400Hz 8GB one to max out my memory and now both the sticks are running at 2400Hz. I haven't noticed any major lag as of yet because of the underclocking. I have the 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD model, thus I don't have any option to upgrade the storage.  -> If you have a budget of around 60-62k, go for it. But if you can extend it to 67-68k, go for either Legion 5 or Nitro 5. They offer better thermals and a few extra quirks."

Please be aware of this before ordering the product. When I asked the product to be returned due to the wrong specification, they harshly denied it. I am aware that it is hard to find laptops Made in India, but that is one of the reasons I had ordered this product.  Regarding the product The overall look is premium, there is an elegance in this model, but there is a serious problem with this model. The keyboard area heats up very high just in minutes. The reason is that the CPU temperature reads 70 degrees in no time and goes up to 99 degrees before throttling. Also, your hands will feel the heat from the keyboard very very noticeably if you even slightly stress the CPU with heavy-duty software, if you are using it for gaming or content creation, you will have to disable turbo tech from the BIOS, else I fear that this kind of heat will affect other components. And if you disable turbo, essentially you are limiting performance which is the whole purpose of buying this laptop.  This review is after a day of use, will see how things turn out in long run."

The hinge mechanism is the only point of skepticism after witnessing another laptop with the same design suffer issues after vigorous usage over 2 years. However, the plastic used is of better quality than compared to the other device. Quite easy to disassemble and clean. The lid doesn't wobble at any angle, even as I type this review with the device perched on one thigh as I lean back (don't judge my posture). The overall construction is quite sturdy, and there is no squeaking or creaking when moving the laptop without due care. The laptop easily holds its own when my pet (7kgs) decides to use it as his landing pad from 2-3 ft. The lid does catch hand grease and dust, while the deck and keyboard are quite the opposite, and the same goes for cleaning either. Word of caution, just don't be too rough with the lid when opening or closing.  The screen has 120 hz refresh rate, but the response time is about 21 ms, which is not the optimal. Games like COD-Warzone, State of Decay 2, Apex Legends (no India based servers), etc., will show the slightest of ghosting and delay. Expect up-to 80% accuracy when chasing moving targets. I suck at it though. The color accuracy is decent (72% Adobe-RGB), however you'll need to correct it manually before achieving proper visual accuracy as mentioned above. The bezels could be thinner, and a privacy shutter on the webcam would've been much appreciated.  The keyboard comes with royal blue color backlight with 2 stages of intensity, controlled by the F10 key. The key presses assist in touch typing, however one may find the keyboard a tad unaligned when compared to the natural desktop feel. I have mistyped on occasions. The power button has a capacitive fingerprint sensor which has missed my digit once in a blue-moon (literally). Pressing said button isn't as satisfactory and requires more force for actuation that visibly perceivable. The G (F7) key can be used to switch to high performance mode, which will amp up the fan acoustics. The fans generally stay quiet unless under medium load, where they start off from medium speeds and sound and can go all the way up to feeling like one is sitting in an aeroplane taking off from the runway with earplugs to dim the outside noise. They do get quite loud (see the pun I made?) and it can easily douse out the noise made by room heaters and other such peripherals.  It comes with 1*USB 3.1 gen 1 type A port, 2*USB 2.0 type A port, 1*Display Port, 1*Thunderbolt 3 USB type C port with 10 Gb/s and display supporting 1* 4K monitor, & 1 UHS-1 SD Card reader slot. The barrel connector styled charging port delivers a massive 240W power rating, and the battery capacity is 68 Whr (largest that Dell could fit in here, maybe). The Dell Power Manager Software has options that help the user customize the battery usage as required, with further granular controls in the Alienware command Centre. The Dell update manager assists in keeping all device drivers up-to-date, however one must be aware of the Malicious and Buggy Windows update. It's possible to add a secondary M.2 PCIe 3.0 SSD (2280) in RAID 0 & RAID 1 configuration, with the primary being 500GB of 2242 type.  Be mindful of the exhausts and air intakes around the chassis as these can easily get blocked when used like a traditional laptop, which will result in minute thermal throttling until the fans have woken up from their slumber. The Keyboard deck can start to feel toasty and uncomfortable for many incase the fans have been set to quiet mode, where the overwhelming heat can set the laptop to hibernate (97-103 degree C). Start up from this state can take up 30 seconds, while the usual time taken is 20% of the previously mentioned time.  The CPU & GPU combination performs as expected from the specs sheet, and coupled with granular level controls over the fans speed and the battery, its fairly difficult to overheat this device, but not impossible. The chassis aids in driving some of the heat, but its advised to practice some gymnastics to maintain 64-92 degrees when gaming in 100 frames per second in games like COD-Warzone & Apex Legends at high detail levels. Otherwise, State of Decay2, GTA-V and GTA-Online will deliver anywhere between 70-110 fps based on the availability of air flow and graphics settings (please dont play any games in 60 fps, it is supposed to render in 60+ fps for the game to feel superfluous || capping things to 60fps will save battery, however this device has other power management options to assist that).  Lastly, the audio is better than expected, with the built-in speakers throwing some really loud and bass heavy beats. The laptop is light enough to hold in one and use with the other. No Qualms there whatsoever. The touchpad is amazingly accurate at tracking, clicks anywhere for primary select, surprisingly precise with palm rejection, and has dimensions that support both latitudinal and longitudinal movement post selection. The lid doesn't tilt back completely and the SD Card sits only half way into the body of the Card Reader. The i/o is laid out in 60-40 percentage along the left-right edges respectively, and the Wi-Fi chip used is AX201 (futureproof, depending on the future)."
Dell-i5-10200H-G15-5510-D560473WIN9B,laptop,"The screen quality is nice and the battery life is sufficient for day to day tasks like making a presentation or checking and responding to e-mails. I haven't tested battery life for gaming, but I wouldn't recommend it. (It might still last atleast an hour I suppose). NOTE: The CPU runs hot and I don't think it's suitable for use on your lap. Be ready for it to get hotter still during a gaming session, the cooling system seems to be working well, but the back still gets pretty hot. The rest of the package performs to my satisfaction."
Dell-i5-10200H-G15-5510-D560473WIN9B,laptop,Just received . Seems very good. Started using it.

Dell-Latitude-3510-i3-10110U-Warranty,laptop,Performance is good but sound quality is bad
Dell-Latitude-3510-i3-10110U-Warranty,laptop,"As always, a great product from Dell. I'm using this laptop for different purposes such as Recording, Video Editing, Online Classes etc...  Great video quality🎦. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Sound is also fine🔊.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High Speed🐆.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Battery Life🔋.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Fast Charging🔌.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  I'm using the apps such as DaVinci Resolve and Cubase in this laptop. Still no drop in speed and performance.  I also did a small upgrade to Windows 10.  I highly recommend this Laptop.  I guess this is the best notebook laptop in the price range.  This is my first laptop. I'm highly satisfied and I'm loving it."
Dell-Latitude-3510-i3-10110U-Warranty,laptop,Look wise its good. Performance is fine for business purposes its getting heated beside the touch pad on top. Lite weight and screen view and camera is good.
Dell-Latitude-3510-i3-10110U-Warranty,laptop,Nice at this cost but not for gaming . But can use it in every day and office work .
Dell-Latitude-3510-i3-10110U-Warranty,laptop,"This laptop has issues. It looks fine for a business laptop, but I have problems with battery. I also have problems with the touchpad. Even with a clean install of Windows, the touchpad delays for at least 1-2 seconds before responding. With a USB mouse, this is not an issue. With power, the laptop will sometimes go to sleep, then not come out of sleep unless I hold the power button down. I had this happen at another client. The only commonality was both laptops with issues were purchased through Amazon. The ones we get from Dell directly do not seem to have this issue. Not sure why."
Lenovo-IdeaPad-Fingerprint-Graphite-82FG010AIN,laptop,"People for who thought of expanding memory in future, please do not buy this laptop, it does not support RAM memory expansion."

ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,"Well, First things first. I got it for 90k. It's definitely value for money. Zephyrus G14s are extremely well built. You can feel the top quality design and touch. Got the white color one, without the animiex one. Tbh it doesn't matter that much. I got this for productivity and heavy editing. Comes out as a swanky business laptop as well. Wanted to go for Zenbook in the same range, but stuck to this. This was released on 26 May 2021 in India. Completely new line with AMD chips. AMD 5000 series chips  Pros: - Top quality build - Radeon 7 5000 series processor is a monster - Ran high fps games, with no lag - Armoury app makes switching between settings easy. You can control fan Speed, fan noise, display, sound, battery performance and everything - The speakers are good, with Dolby, you can feel the quality of the speakers. Comparable to macbooks - Comes in with pre-installed Windows home and office for lifetime - The touchpad is better than macbook's. Very smooth. - Keyboard has good travel and feel. You'll like it. - Multiple ports, has c-type usb charging. You can connect to any 65W block and this thing charges - Gave me a good 9hr on single charge with moderate usage (need to test more)  Cons: - No webcam. Like many top rog machines, this does not have one. I personally have no problem with this. Anyways, most of the laptops have bad integrated cams. Many creators use external cameras anyways, so having a mediocre one doesn't make sense - only 8GB RAM. But you can upgrade this later. Again, it boils down to shelling out extra 4k for another 8GB Ram and adding it - The key colors in the white model is Silverish. You need to get used to it. But not a deal breaker - Only 512 GB Memory. But this is not a deal breaker. Even MSI prestige series lineup comes with 512GB in this range  G14 Zephyrus range is among the top of the line machines from ASUS. Definitely go for it if you're okay with the offering."
ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,"The laptop looks premium and elegant. Processor coupled with 4GB graphics card is a beast. Very fast and handles Photoshop effortlessly. I have not used it for gaming but I am sure it can handle games effortlessly. Finger print sensor is quick. Battery life is around 8 hrs for normal use. Speakers are quite decent with dolby support. Screen is nice with great viewing angles and good colour representation. Extra slot for RAM expansion available. Only shortcomings that I felt are lack of RJ45 connection, no web cam, only 2 usb ports and only one inbuild port for SSD. ROG sleeve is only enough to carry laptop, not enough space for charger and other accessories. Overall its a good product."
ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,"Super. Value for money.  Pros: 1. CPU performance. 3.0 GHz Base Speed, Up to 4.3 GHz. So code build is super fast. 2. Screen resolution. 2K super quality. You will fall in love with the screen. 3. Keyboard key quality. 4. Solid body and design 5. Dolby sound. The quality of sound is super awesome 6. Perfomance. The M.2 NVMe is super fast. The laptop boot time is just 2-4 seconds.  Cons: 1. Sometimes the palm area becomes hot if there is no proper ventilation. 2. Display scaling problem because you are using a 2K display. You have to set monitor scaling at 150% to get a normal screen experience. So for some apps, you have to adjust with the scaling or the icons will be blurry. Not a serious issue. 3. Lack of Ethernet port 4. Lack of webcam"
ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,"The Laptop doesn't come with a camera, hence its totally useless for my work of online meetings.  Colour given to me is White, though mentioned Metallic in the description.  Better deal with accessories available in Vijaya Sales on this product  The pouch is of low quality.  The machine however has a fantastic processor."
ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,"The product is very good, built quality awesome, conpact powerfull machine. But i am facing a fingerprint censor issue after a windows update, don't know its a hardware or software issue. But my fingerprint censor not working after windows update. The one n only issue with Asus zephyrus G14."
ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,Don't buy if service center is not present in your city. On-site service is very poor. Their on-site engineer(so called) don't know nothing.

ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,"Laptop is best in its class, I ordered this coz of its powerful processor so I can do my heavy work on it and it has powerful gpu (which to be honest I don't need coz I don't play games but I needed this for future for augmented reality apps). Only thing that is missing is webcam (reason for returning), coz after covid, we need webcam for online meetings, etc. Yes we can buy external webcam but it'll occupy one port and while travelling need to take extra care of it. Hope Asus will include webcam in future updates and plz mention in description that this laptop is missing webcam. Overall best quality product. Thanks Amazon for helping with return."

The laptop was fine till 20 days . when I was just browsing in the internet the laptop suddenly the laptop turned off and it never turned on again . Then I get it to the service centre near me which is 65 km away from my home . And I got the laptop back after 16 days , they told me the keyboard was complaint and they replaced it . Everything was okay after using it for two more days now it turned off again and is not turning on . I am completely dissatisfied with this laptop and it is now a mess to me . I need to travel again to service centre which is 65 km away from my home . This is worst decision in my life . I had never regreted like this ever before . The amount rupees 95k feels like a complete waste . Plaese don't buy this laptop if you need a good use of your laptop ."
ASUS-Zephyrus-Office-2019-Moonlight-GA401QH-BM070TS,laptop,"I bought thorough showroom Pros 1 sound quality is excellent 2 battery backup is excellent 3 can handle apps like android studio like etc  Cons 1 there is difference between r7 5800hs and r7 5800h processor. This processor is slightly lower powerful than h processor 2 only 8 gb RAM, which is not enough. Yes we have an update option but that makes another 4.5k 3 512 GB SSD is definately not enough games like gta 5 is 100 gb u cannot play more than 2 games 4 this processor is Lot more slower than Intel's i7 11800h Atlast this is actually an over rated lap. There are plenty of alternatives ex acer's nitro i7 11800h which has more powerful processor, more storage, 144hz display with less cost."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"The description mentioned a 15 inch laptop but it is in fact a 12 inch. Fine but I had to go through the entire install to find out it was actually an I5 instead of an I7 as advertised. Besides that, it runs fine but disappointed because I thought it was a really good deal for what was advertised and now its just Ok"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Pro : can do basic things fast, small size to carry any where. Cons : if you want to work at home so may be it is a good idea to have a big secondary monitor."

Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"This is very good model at a very good price point. It would have made a really good travel computer had it worked out. It didn't. I got the machine out of the box, and booted it up. It loaded Windows 10, and everything was looking pretty good. But, to be sure I brought up the pre-boot menu (tapping on F-12 when you see the Dell Logo), and ran the diagnostics. Immediately alarms went off when testing the Solid State Drive with a critical error (2000-0151) indicating that the SSD was about to die, and needed to be replaced. Bummer. I immediately arranged for a return of the defective computer. The vendor did a good job processing the refund. But, this problem shouldn't have been there to begin with. Somehow the vendor's technician didn't spot it. Apparently, the computer's SSD wasn't even checked. The signed checklist that came with the shipment includes CPU, RAM, optical drives, screen resolution and etc; but there is no mention of checking the SSD. Had I not thought to run the diagnostics, I wouldn't have seen this flaw either. It makes me wonder how many customers are actually checking such things. So, this is what I recommend: whenever you buy a ""certified refurbished"" computer from Amazon, run the Diagnostics immediately. If the tests all pass, you've got a good computer for a good price. If the tests fail, you only have the inconvenience of sending back the unit."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I've used a number of Dell products in the past. My main computer is a Latitude E6540, weighing in at a hefty 6.5 lbs. My company recently issued me a Latitude 5590, somewhat lighter and much faster. Both are 15"". I thought at first that the E7250 had an identical key board (not including the numeric keypad on the right) to the 5590. However, in measuring from the ""tilde"" to the ""backspace"", I find the 5590 is 10.75 inches and the E7250 is 10.25...not much compromise given the size of the E7250. I am very pleased with performance, compared to my E6540. I expect most of the video issues I experience are related to my 10MB DSL rather than the computer itself. I left the E7250 in ""sleep"" mode last night and found I had 90% battery in the AM. The small screen size...adequate for what I need...is more than compensated by the light weight of this unit. Best of all, it fits in my E6540 docking station, so I can use it easily with my KVM and large monitor when I'm sitting at home. Update: After working with it before, the smaller size of the keyboard becomes more apparent. I find I have to be aware of initial finger placement and ""think small"" when typing. However, it is very usable. The other note is that battery life continues to be great. I use the computer intermittently, using sleep mode often...and don't recharge for three or four days. ""Booting"" up after sleep mode is very quick. I'm still very pleased with this little machine."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Why should I buy an expensive computer when I can have this for a small price! This computer is excellent and it outperforms my newer Inspiron 11 (3152) in performance. The laptop looks and works great. I installed an 8Gb RAM module that I had sitting in a drawer and now I have a 16GB RAM machine. The back shows some wear (I don't care, I don't look on the back anyway) but the palmrest looks brand new. I don't care it is not touch, but, as my little daughter says ""touch screens are for tablets and phones"". I Will never buy a new computer again."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"My Dell Latitude E7250 arrived on time and was well packaged. Having been refurbished it had a barely recognizable scuff on the outside cover. I was traveling this last week so I had an opportunity to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised by its quick boot up time and the battery lasted for 3 hours before I recharged it at half capacity. I was doing emails and checking some web pages, not watching movies. The price for this certified refurbished unit was great. Since I don't like Windows 10, I downloaded Classic Shell for the Windows 7 look and have been enjoying it ever since. the size is great for slipping into a back pack and still large enough to view web pages or video."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,I ordered a refurbished model similar to what I had been using at work. It is an out-of-production model but absolutely wonderful! Fast operating speeds. Lighted keypad. Easy to use. Came all pre-loaded with basic program/app needs. I highly recommend this route.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"It didn't seem like the particular refurbisher I bought this from, PrimeTimeBuys, did much refurbishing. Maybe what they actually sell is more like a used laptop with a 90-day guarantee.  When I ordered the laptop, the first one I got had a touchpad that didn't work.  The pointer didn't move well.  If somebody's refurbishing a laptop, they would notice if the touchpad doesn't work! I tried various drivers and it still didn't work.  So I told the seller. They scheduled a pickup and mailed me a replacement laptop.   I ran all sorts of diagnostics on the replacement laptop - the built-in pre-boot diagnostics, and Dell has a free diagnostic program called SupportAssist.  That gave one error message that I managed to fix after some back and forth with the Dell technical support, by downloading some software.   And the diagnostics said the battery was near the end of its useful life.  Again, you'd think a refurbisher would run diagnostics on the laptop and find these problems!   The seller sent me a replacement battery.   So now, everything seems fine.  It's a nice laptop, if everything that needs to be fixed, IS fixed."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I bought this Dell laptop used for a great price because I have the same one at work and really enjoy it. It’s actually better than my work machine as the keyboard is backlit. I can recommend this laptop and the seller, Odyssey Computer without reservations."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"So it used to be when you ordered a ""refurbished"" PC more times than not you received a dirty, used, not refurbished in any way, PC in a box. Now that Amazon has its own refurbishing program, with a 90 day guarantee, you can buy a used PC and have confidence that it actually was cleaned and checked before you purchased it. I am very happy with this purchase. Is Jeff Bezos the Devil? If Amazon keeps killing the competition with better and better ideas will we all be bowing before him in a few decades when Amazon rules the earth?"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,The laptop I received repeatedly powered off without warning and ran much slower than another laptop I have with similar specifications. I had to return it. Disappointing.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I advise caution against this purchase. PC struggled pretty hard with basic tasks (for a machine with 8GB and an SSD).  I know the price is enticing, but you're throwing your money away.  My PC died 30 days past the 90 day warranty. I contacted the seller and was told : We're sorry to hear about the issue you are having with your machine. Unfortunately, this item's 90-Day warranty period expired on July 14th, 2019. We apologize for the inconvenience.  -Odyssey Computers  You've been warned."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I got this laptop as a graduation present last year, and initially it worked fine, however after a few months it started having issues. The main problem that continues to persist is the cooling system. I would be working on a project or assignment, and the system would shut itself down every 5 minutes or so. I took the system to my university tech support, who told me that they had the same problem when they tried it. They attempted to fix the issue by dismantling the laptop and greasing the fan, which apparently was not keeping up with cooling the system effectively, causing it to shut down on its own. It has worked better since then, but I continue to have this issue from time to time. Other than that everything runs fine. Every system I have installed is fast and efficient. On a final note, the space bar is kind of a pain. Doesn't always space when you press it."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"First glance the computer was a little onthe heavy side and bulky. After start up and set up, updates installed, CAD program installed and calibrated; it's not a bad computer at all. Runs fast and smooth graphics on CAD. I ended up ordering RAM upgrade, 16 GB duel Channel kit and it makes a huge difference. Spent an extra $180 but it's well worth it. Over all I would definitely buy another and recommend for general AutoCAD use. I can deal with the weight and bulkiness. Going to order a laptop backpack instead of regular carrying case. Only negative so far is windows and all the junk programs and apps they have. Had to spend hours uninstalling and cleaning up the OS so it wouldn't chew up the resources and slow the laptop to a crawl. This laptop with Linux would be Mint! Might have to reformat and go with Linux if windows doesn't clean up their act and leave all the junk apps and programs in the trash where they belong."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"HEADS UP!  [Don’t worry if it says Windows 10 Pro is not activated. 3 minute video solved it for me: https://youtu.be/-wM_a74F56s ]  Had this baby for a year as an Engineering Tech Student and have a to do list for you.  1. Activate (stated above) 2. Turn on TurboBoost (5 clicks) 3. Add RAM (optional/recommended) 4. Make sure it can breathe 5. Put in High Performance Mode (3 clicks)  I love 70% of this computer 🙂  Pros: -Speedy Intel i5 5300u processor (Limited Edition 😄 Old-School Broadwell Processor that is discontinued for newer slower chips. Faster than some base-model Surface computers on standard settings like Surface Go, Surface Pro 3/4, & base-level 2018 Surface laptop) I’ve walked in Microsoft stores and ran tests for fun 😂  -Reliable as heck (Has splash drains under laptop for spills on the keyboard ⌨️. I’ve never tried them but looks legit)  -Compact/Professional Look & Feel (Small tool that can do ALMOST anything)  -Ports. Never dongle again  -Bluetooth  -Hotspot Capable & WiFi Sharing (If you unscrew it, there is a spot for you to add your own computer SIM so you can use a mobile carrier anywhere. Usually this is reserved for high-end computers because this thing used to be.)  -Has a CARD READER built-in 🤯 (Perfect if you run a business and don’t have a square reader. This means your laptop could even accept Apple/Google/Samsung Pay)  -Very glare resistant screen (Matte screen makes it pretty good to look at outside since there are no reflections)  -Charges quickly (Fastest charging laptop I’ve personally owned. Not a monster in comparison to premium devices, but is no slouch)  -Fan (Quiet enough for lectures without being noticed, but not 100% silent. Don’t worry about fan noise unless you’re running really intense programs. Word and chrome are not intense lol)  -Keyboard (Gets bright, hugs the fingers, reliable, smaller form factor is good for college lectures.)  -When it stars up it sounds like a tiny jet ✈️ (Only lasts 2-5 seconds. I just think the fan sound is pretty cool 😁)  Cons: -Display is narrow & not super color accurate. (The screen is not pretty. Low version of HD and has color shift when you tilt it or turn it. But there are worse I’ve seen)  -Max Brightness Too Low 🤷🏾‍♂️ -Min Brightness Too High 🤷🏾‍♂️ (Not by a lot though. It’s NOT bad. To me, it’s just a pet peeve because I wish I could go a little higher in direct sunlight and lower in a pitch-black room)  -No touchscreen 😞  -Small trackpad 😞  -Really hot on top left 🔥 (wear pants or use a table because the processor is all work and no play. Enough to make me question why. DO NOT leave this awake in your backpack unless you want your water bottle to cook ramen 🍜 ♨️🥵. A couple times I was in a rush and forgot to put it to sleep and opened up my backpack to a screaming fan, almost dead battery, and a bag that felt like a car in Summer. It felt like a fire hazard & like my bag was bound to have a meltdown. It’s my fault because I choked it out and left it in high performance mode with no air. BUT, if you press the sleep button before storing it, this will NEVER happen and almost all your battery will be ready for you 🙂 So be responsible 🤷🏾‍♂️)  -Big-ish bezels 😞 (Your friends are never gonna think you’re using something as good as a MacBook even though its kinda comparable on a spec sheet)  -NOT designed for gaming. (Even though this meets every minimum system requirement for every basic game, don’t get this for gaming. The integrated graphics card is PERFECT for productivity, but not gaming. Sadly, none of the bus ports are fast enough to hook up externally to a graphics card either. So, video rendering suffers a little. 3D printing works fine though.)  -Battery Life is up to you: Pro/Con (Want 9 hrs on a single charge? Low power mode and battery saver. Low brightness. Want 1.2 hours of peak performance? High performance mode, overclock, never sleep, full brightness, 20 chrome tabs, CADD in the background and all windows animations active along with an android emulator.  Conclusion:  Bang for buck, this is AMAZING. Even though a better screen, bigger trackpad, & a thunderbolt port would be nice, that’s ALL I can say bad about it. This OUTPERFORMS many computers that are hundreds more dollars and has features many forgot about. This machine is my daily driver and I’m pretty happy with it. If you do have $600-$700 to dish though, there are faster computers. But for this price, this thing does more than most desktops of a similar price."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"For the price, this is a gem of a laptop. Came very clean, looking much better than any of my existing laptops despite being a refurbished model, and not loaded with bloatware. All the specs were as advertised and the battery lasted much longer than I expected (used it off and on all day on a full charge and it still had plenty of juice to keep going). The screen is very easy to read for my old eyes and it's fast, too. I'm very pleased with this purchase!"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Unboxed the laptop and immediately noticed a bunch of tape glue all over the bottom. Right after cleaning that up, I realize that the screen could not possibly be the ADVERTISED 15 inches. I confirmed with a ruler, just over 12. At this point I had already decided I was going to send it back when the fan starts blowing and making an AWFUL grinding noise. Now extra annoyed, I try to factory reset the laptop to send it back. Plug in the charger so it can begin reset, and the charger doesn't work. Check the reviews and another person had the same fan grinding sound. Did you send me the same laptop??  What a joke. Nice try guys."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,I don't like the color/finish because finger prints show up a lot. I'd rather have silver. Otherwise it's great. Packaged well and works perfectly. It took me a little while to get used to the smaller size and they're is no key pad on the side. Three back lighting is nice.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Well it was great for about 6 months, and now it will not even turn on. During its time in my posession, I barely even had a chance to use it, and would estimate maybe 3 hours of usage total. Tried to use it today and it wont turn on. The screen is black. Its already taken a crap on me!"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Laptop hardware is as described and functioning fine; although in retrospect, I wish I'd opted for a bigger display. Widows was missing proper video driver; but, since I bought this to run Linux on, it didn't affect me like it might others."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I bought this laptop in the month of December 2020 for a relative, he uses it for his daily work using photoshop and illustrator, the version installed is 2020 and runs without any problem, now is also installed the version of Ableton live and also runs without problems. It is a good machine and is according to the need that my family member had. The fact that this laptop has a SSD hard drive helps the operating system and programs that have been installed so far run very smoothly."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I purchased this for my son during the stay at home order so that he could remotely attend school. The first laptop died within a couple of days. I requested a refund and the customer service representative talked me into accepting a replacement. The replacement worked for about 5 months and died. I requested to return it, but since I didn't purchase an extended warranty on Amazon, I'm out of luck. Two faulty computers from the same company. I will not be purchasing from them again."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I purchased this laptop in August 31, 2020. I had to withdraw the semester and didn't use the laptop until January 2021. Battery life was so poor, it couldn't stay on for 2 hs class. Soon, it dropped down that couldn't work at all without being plugged in. I reached out the seller, they apologized but my warranty expired last month. I replaced the battery and used it slightly- for my homework, done in Microsoft office and submitted in ... I turned it off in May, until now - getting ready for fall semester. HDD died. I'm hoping to be able to save my files... So, you better stay safe and find better devices"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,This relatively compact laptop from Skytech USA is a gem that looks and behaves like new. I could not be more satisfied.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Had to send it back. Fan didn’t work on it per the Diagnostics.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Product looked good, easy setup. But the keys didn't work properly. Many were unresponsive, I had to press them repeatedly or hit them very hard to get a response. Had to return it. Very disappointed because it was a nice size and weight for traveling."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Diagnostics revealed the battery is at 50% lifespan.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Purchased January. Stopped working September. Called SJ Computers to see if there was anything they can do to help even if I had to pay for repairs but they refused and advised there was only a 90 day time frame. So I only got 8 months of life on this laptop.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,It arrived earlier than expected. Really like the thinner size and lighter weight. Good laptop for the price
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I've bought my share of computers, but this one is the best ever. $240 for an I5 laptop with 256 SSD drive? Ive had it running nearly continuously for three weeks, booting it up and down....no issues. I bought mine without an optical drive for cost savings. Mike C"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Would recommend extended warranty. Did not put it to heavy use and it was still running fine when the 90 day window expired. Between 5 and 6 months it started charging the battery to only 7% capacity. I switched the charger from the off brand I received to a genuine Dell. It worked for about 2 more weeks. Now I'm sitting with a laptop that won't even turn on that I have had for barely 6 months.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I had to get a new laptop ASAP for work and I ordered exactly what I had before but this refurbished unit had a bad battery and a charger that didn’t charge. I ended up spending money on a new charger and battery, Amazon would only offer an Amazon credit for the amount spent instead of a refund. All around poor experience. I’ll never go this route again. Hopefully this helps someone else."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Shipping sucked so 3 stars. I dropped another star because the laptop has to be plugged in for it to work since battery doesnt hold a charge.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Almost everything about this computer was great, the only problem I had with it was the airflow. when it heats up it gets quite hop, I can put my hand on it would hurt. I would still recommend if you don't plan on using for gaming."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I ordered a Dell 7250, but when I recv'd the order it was a Dell 7275 which is not what I wanted. Because of time constraints, was forced to keep the 7275. Smaller screen. Don't need a tablet."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Old and dependable, perfect for any Linux distro. Can you en handle multiple monitors"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Good value for money. Is not a touch screen. Battery life is excellent. The key board was covered with cat hairs. Probably spent 3 days cleaning all the cat hairs out. Other than that I love the computer. I love cats too, just not their hairs in my keyboard."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Cheapest quality! It wasn’t a year old and the screen was leaking fluid.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,It is still a really nice machine. We bought this for my daughter and it's actually a late 2015 vintage machine that's been refurbished. It is a business class machine and better than what we could have gotten retail for the same price in July 2018. We're really happy with it so far (only a couple days in) and the only knock is the misleading year in the description.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,The battery developed a dangerous bulge just a few days after the return period (90 days). Seller would not accept return or pay for replacement battery. This is understandable - they are under no such obligation - but how do you rate a laptop with such a problem highly?
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Looks like new; no scratches, works well so far and hope there will be no issues in the future. Will recommend."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,nosotros compramos muchos de estos equipos para reemplazar los más viejos se desempeñan de una forma correcta y con un bajo costo podemos mejorar la capacidad de los usados en la empresa.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I love this machine. I work from home and wanted something small and quick. I realize it’s an older model, but it’s does everything I need and the price is unbeatable."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Slight cosmetic damage, nothing too serious. Ran diagnostics upon arrival, everything checked out. Great computer overall. Processor is a beast lol"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Received computer in a timely manner but when went to set up shut itself down and would not restart. We had to return to try and get it fixed. Just an extra step that wasn't planning on making. Hopefully will soon be resolved
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Junk overheats error inoperable fan it got so hot couldn't touch it for 3 hours I can't get ahold of the seller mailbox is full, have to wait 7 day for responding and don't have my money to buy another one I bought this for work and school now I have to use a 5 yr old tablet that atleast works!"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"The product is just as advertised. Product is looking new and shows little to no sign of wear. However, the model that I received has a loose SSD which caused numerous BSODs and boot errors. Fortunately, a quick, manual, tightening of the SSD seems to fix all problems and is working fine again."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Light weight and great price everything works great!
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Power cord doesn’t work. I thought it was the battery at first, so I ordered a mew one. Turns out it would not post the new battery either."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,This is a laptop with good hardware characteristics but in the outside you can see scratches and some dents on the sides.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"This laptop is fast, easy to carry, and meets my needs"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I purchased this product from Tech Venture on May 11, 2019. But this was a bad purchase. From the very beginning the battery didn't work at all, never got charged. Always showed 0%."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Nice in general Compaq laptop
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Cero problemas con el producto
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I called for help with it and I was taken care of promptly , thanks and very understanding as I’m not very savvy with the laptop yet !"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,My IT group recommended that I purchase refurbished laptops. I bought it in Jun 2020 and it died in Mar 2021. Don't do it.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Bogus. Touchpad doesn't work. Slow computer. Updating with new driver doesn't work. buying a separate compatible mouse doesn't work. Extremely slow system. It's a 350 USD Junk.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,I bought this computer to run heavy duty programs like Arcgis and it holds up pretty nicely. I’ve had no real issues with it. It also came looking brand new. The company did a good job renewing it. I would recommend
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,The battery would not stay charged. The computer had to be plugged in from day 1. Ended up returning
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"I would love to have the sound lauder and touch screen, but the product is very good. Thank you!"
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,I love the speed it has but it is a little small i am used to a larger 17 inch one. overall i am very pleased with the item and the speed which it came shipped to me.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,This is day 30 and I like everything about my refurbished laptop. Was afraid that I would have problems and it never happened. Best purchase ever. Now I’m going to try a refurbished desktop.
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,"Battery life is horrible, even while plugged in."
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,It works good and that's what I need it to do
Dell-Latitude-i5-5300U-2-30Ghz-Renewed,laptop,Fabulous price for a machine that gets the job done quickly. Great boot up and quick response times

Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,The display developed issues within 2 months of purchase. The service center has the laptop now for more than 2 months and it has not been fixed yet.  The laptop was good but it seems Acer can't repair it's own products. Definitely not worth any amount of money to have to deal with such bad service.
Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,The laptop started hanging from the first day of use. Then it completely froze and did not not register any command. Had to return it.
Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,the best laptop with best display 3:2 aspect ratio.Best Ultra book . very thin and lightweight laptop. only negative side is the speaker
Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,"One week of use. Looks good. Good display though not matt. Thin and light. Adequate performance. Was slightly warm while using zoom. App switching and all gestures are smooth( after a driver install from acer site). Some optimisation issues are popping up in between. Build is fine, there is mild flex on the screen and on pressing the top of the lid while closed it can be depressed. Overall good option, if you don't need to run heavy tasks. Pros. Good display Track pad is good Thin and light weight Thunderbolt port available Adequate performance Cons: Battery life barely adequate (6hrs max) Software optimisation issues Keyboard needs improvement ( little soft and lacks feedback) USB 2 port doesn't serve the purpose ( a usb 3 port is also present) Mild heating even in not very demanding tasks Speaker volume is low"
Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,"It was working fine for a few months. Then started with weird problems of being irresponsive after a few minutes without cpu/memory high usage, temp was low too. Then suddenly it stopped booting, got stuck at Acer logo.  I purchased this at 66000, now price is also 53000. Not going purchase Acer laptops anymore, neither will recommend to anyone I know."
Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,It worked well for 10 days and after that display went black. The service provided by Acee is pathetic. Twice their engineer came did something for about an hour and could not repair it.Now he is telling mother board is faulty and is to be replaced.Lets see what happens after that. But this product is not worth its money do not buy it.
Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,"Hello ppl I am writing in distress. I bought this thing with 16gb ram 1 tb ssd from acer store and it was delivered less than a week back. Today, after I had hibernated it, it has refused to start. I am getting blue screen with mouse pointer responsive. But since it's a public holiday and weekend, the company is dead. No support, take ur risks. Even went up to the escalation matrix and they were rude to say the least, unhelpful being part of the job. My job is at stake but the gentlemen tell me it's late and not done at this time of the night. A fair appreciation when ur job is not at stake coz I cant recover data I produced in last three days by monday morning when their support opens up. Well I guess u pay for ur mistakes. First time I trusted acer instead of hp/ asus/ dell and the lesson is hard. Take ur risks guys and buy it.  Update after a yr. the laptop has its own mind wrt the shift key. u cant work on it. acer says we dOnt have record of having SolD it to u> they are asking for an invoice which they NeVer sent. when I had asked for an invoIce, they had told ME WE KEEP DIGITAL copies FOR EnvironmentaL stuff> now they seem to have changed their mind> go figure !!"
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,Awesome laptop in this range. It is truly value for money. Dynamic Physical look. It is very good for work from home in this epedemic covid-19.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,Wanted a good laptop for daily usage with Windows and Office. The performance is good and does the everyday tasks well. Comes with Microsoft Office as well. Very happy with the purchase at this price.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,I bought this product but when i open its lid its turn on automatically.... is it defective product or its ok? Let me help to know that
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"I was expecting some basic experience but it struggles a lot. My HP pavilion with 2.2GHZ works better than this. I was like oh god what I have did, because I have exchanged my pavilion to get this.  but now, 3rd power on after driver updates, BIOS update, now 2004 version is downloading, it's better ( only a nominal paise better)  but I need to keep considering the price and it has camera and Mic which my pavilion does not have.  To get this far, I need to apply Windows improve performance support link on new laptop with AMD ( I do not know what happened to AMD ( might be they are concentrating on other things where Intel dominates).  I truly disappointed with this performance. Every time I click I click I click, I need to wait. In edge browser typing like stuttering.  Think Edge is like that ( which is lightest) than any browser for Windows.  The display is glare glare glare if you do not have proper lighting.  I use on natural light, even with 20 watt LED room light, it glares.  so far, as it was mentioned in the product pictures, the AMD Athlon version is tablet replacement and it is complete 15.6 inch ( need to check diagonal).  I saw one review with horizontal measurement so clarifying others who check reviews before buying it.  It has integrated RAM 4GB, usable 3.38GB and 1 TB Seagate usable 930GB.  Over all, I'm keeping as it serves my purpose and basic working laptop with Windows home OS and Office 2019 ) the software's itself comes close to the laptop price if it bought separately.  The funny part, I have HP omen Rs.1Lakh and above, this laptop I bought for R.22,000, my family likes this one than Omen since it has brushed aluminum like feel platinum grey compared to Omen matte black.  Update 24/10/2020.  Now, the laptop seems to be better.  After 2004 update installed, I have 1.4GB RAM left for other applications.  Total 4GB RAM > user available 3.38 GB ( pathetic) I don't know the user available is so low due to RAM is directly soldered to the Mother board. Windows only uses 1.9 to 2GB.  but anyhow, I need to upgrade RAM or user experience might not be best.  Update 07/11/2020.  I need to upgrade the RAM if not, the user experience would be like order coffee and get it by tomorrow but you need it today.  The display is like kind of white (eee) not balanced sharpness/contrast and brightness. I use it for my work and rest is Netflix, Amazon prime and movies collection I have.  The exceptional part of this laptop is sound. Yes, the sound. The sound is best, way better than any computer ( I should say) or is it because of Dolby atmos.  Yes, I'm typing it in the middle of the movie to praise the sound quality.  and yes, I could conclude to myself Dolby atmos is better than DTS X with Bang & Olufsen . Yes, it is. Hail to Dolby.  Update 15/11/2020,  Installed 4GB 2400MHZ RAM, even though this model compatible up to 12GB RAM since it has 4GB onboard RAM (soldered directly to the motherboard) I'm forced to use 4GB RAM.  If I use 8GB RAM + 4GB onboard RAM, I get the average of these 2, which could 12/2=6GB RAM which is now my usable RAM 4GB RAM added + 4GB ono board RAM.  Yes, the performance is increased. Additionally I set Windows search indexing to manual so yes the performance is far better improved. Tested multiple application simultaneously.  Windows explorer + Edge ( 2 tabs)+ Chrome (2 tabs) + Task manager + Excel  all the applications worked better than earlier ( pl.refer my earlier review in the above messages).  Note: Total 8GB installed RAM, 2GB allocated to integrated GPU as a dedicated RAM which is the beauty and welcome thing I like. Since the laptop has integrated GPU comes with 512MB dedicated RAM ( occupies the RAM installed or shares the 4GB RAM installed)  Now, the integrated RAM increased to 2GB which would help me in running GTA V at low settings easily.  and 8GB+ 4GB =12/2 usable RAM would be around 10 or 11GB but the performance would be equal to 6GB.  When we are using dual channel memory, we need to always equip same amount of RAM to get same amount of performance.  Suggestion to Lenovo: Please provide at least onboard 6GB or 4GB fully usable RAM. To buyers, buy RAM along with the laptop. Seriously it meets the requirements and need.  All these reviewing are done with power adapter connected and Extreme performance mode.  The thing I feel could be provided better is the display. The thing I feel wow about this product is the sound."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"The product description clearly mentions that MS Office Student Home 2019 is Pre-installed. This was one of the reasons for selecting this laptop. However, on activation it shows that MS Office is available for only upto 20 September 2020. This is unfair selling practice."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"Stylish design, Slim , Genuine Windows & MS office perfect for student usages."
Acer-SF313-52-13-5-inch-i5-1035G4-Integrated,laptop,"I bought this laptop from local shop for 56 k . Got 1 yr accidental damage warranty and 2 yrs extra onsite warranty (not accidental). So total 3 yrs have been covered , because of that i choose this laptop ahed of less priced asus vivobook.  Now coming to the laptop. This first this you will notice beautiful 13.5 inch screen with 2k resolutionm, excellent anti glare display . Body is fully metalic (apart from hinge cover) and too light(only 1.2 kg) with thin bezzles made it so sexy.  I did quite a research before buying any kind of laptop, i5 10tg generation at this price though little costly where ryzen 4500 series is available at this price which is equivalent to almost i7 9th gen ,but that model wasn't available at offline (because of less supply during pandemic). My primary job is to coding in vs code and Photoshop with a hardy machine, so this machine solves my purpose though it's little costly for my work but atleast I'm covered for next 3 yrs I believe.  Coming to performance , with 512 Nvme ssd and i5 10tg gen it's fast. Never seen any lag or whatsoever. Never tested any game but photoshop worked well.So far I'm happy for the laptop, will update later .  Cons- 1. Speaker is worst , too low volume. Without using hdphn I can't watch a movie from a distance.  2. Heating issue. It heats so fast when you're doing multitasking or using your laptop while charging , hut it has good quality noiseless fans which is great . Hence heat will gradually decrease.  3. Touchpad is little bigger. So sometimes if I'm using it putting on my lap , with slightliest touch at the bottom of touchpad , it reflects as it's so sensitive (though it's not a big cons)  4. Fingerprint sensor is not good at all. Sometimes it doesn't even detect!!  5. I bough irish plus gphx model which is similar to mx150 gphx so not good for gaming.  Pros-  1. The screen is so beautiful. 2. Metalbody hardy laptop. 3. Thunderbolt 3 jack is there. Which can be usable for charging or external gphx or monitor. 4. Noiseless fan.  So unless you get the ryzen 4500 model at this price , then go for this model . It's little pricy but a premium product . Try to buy from offline. I have bought laptop from online and i have seen during sale or special offers ppl who buy laptops sometimes it turn out to be a bad product but in offline even if it's 1 k more its better to go with it rather taking too much risk.plus you can disturb the store incase of service issue which is not the case with amazon."

Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,Received the Laptop (convertible one) today. 1 day earlier than what was promised.. Machine looks very nice and Crisp.. Indeed Very Light. As advertised.. Setup was no-brainer did it myself... Has MS Home/student model.. Remember it does not have Outlook 2019..  Pen fights nicely.. Have not used it in detail.. But it works.. Main Initial concerns - The USB-C port charges VERY VERY SLOWLY... Looks like you have to use the proprietary charger.. Also Battery life looks to be not great.. Will update in 3-4 days.. Possibly 5-6 hours max.. Screen is sharp and there are a number of ports.  Started with only 3 stars now.. No one is commenting on potential battery life.. I am concerned on that.. It will get more stars in the next 3-4 days.. More to come...  Updated Review 18-Aug-2021 I have increased the rating to 4 stars.. The computer does charge through the Usb-c and it charges fast.. I have no issues with that.. Battery life is still 4-5 hours when you are listening to videos etc.. So that is the reason it does not get 5 stars.. But for other practical purposes I like it..  I like the Pen.. it is very useful.. I can make notes and write when I am doing my powerpoint...  The machine is overall very Nice and I would recommend this for someone who understands the size limitations. I have not bent it that much and used it as a tablet.. but I like it.. Keyboard is very nice to use..
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"What I loved: - Light weight, feels just like a large tab - Best touch on anti-glare, highly responsive - Approx 6seconds to start with face recognition authentication - HDMI In/Out, 2 thunder bolt, 2 USB-3, Ethernet foldable/pull-out - Battery is lasting for 6-7hrs, not exceptional but works for me!  What could have been better: - Type-C charging for power bank support - Both cameras are poor - Windows pro edition instead of basic home - Pouch for laptop - Instructions/user manual"
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"Excellent quality product Delivered on time by Amazon Pros: 1)Sturdy, quick start up and performance. 2) Sound quality is superb 3) display is good 4) battery back up is around 6 hours 5) quick charging 6) Tablet mode is good for reading documents ,rear camera is useful while doing calls. 7) Though a bit costly, it deserves.  Cons: Should provide a bag, even if charges a bit more"
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"Laptop works smoothly, so far great will give detailed review after usage,got on Aug 1st. 949 gb was present for use among that 40gb already used for default os and softwares, specifications are present as mentioned, we used default charger,it charged quickly after full charge it stops charging which is good (to increase battery life), type C charging we didnt try yet because watts differs based on it charging time also will differ. Speaker works awesome it is not too louder and not less noisy also, touch screen is smooth Justifies as a premium laptop. Will provide detailed review after usage.  Pro : > light, thin, ease to use > fast response no lag in pen and in touch > good configuration at this price > battery backup is good > 2 webcams are good and hardware quality is good > MSOFFICE + Windows activation are smooth Bothered about: > no fingerprint sensor > power button on right side of laptop > Whenever we touch the outer surface of the laptop our finger marks are visible which we are worried little. > worried about service centers and warranty claim, i have posted questions also about it but dint get any answer yet > no gadgets (which is acceptable) > RJ45 Ethernet port is like a sim slot and once we eject a little and fold it, it will be useable which am little afraid which may have a chance of breakage if we mishandle > 2 speakers are on bottom corners > for recovery fijitsu didnt mention about anything  Note: Overall we liked this laptop very much for its performance, light weight, and most of the ports are available, i didnt mention much about pros which people know by its configuration itself only people who were interest need to accept its con before buying :). we read a lot about fijitsu company's other variant and based on the trust on their reviews we bought this. hope everything should be be fine"
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"Awesome product,delivered with full safety,good battery backup (5hrs+),attractive design,you may go for this. Best for students got it for ₹25,643. But there is no fingerprint unlock, only a power button."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,okay... since its not THAT expensive of a laptop... but still atleast put the right info!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it says that the battery will be working for 5 hours ... when all i do is open gmail for only 3 hours ;... i need to charge the laptop again even when i started working at 100 % within 2.5 hrs i need to charge it again........... baddddd ... realllYYYY BADDDD
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,It is good laptop. Some people are telling that its processor is too slow and not working properly. If you buy a laptop under 26k and you want processor like 35k laptops then forget it. Under 26k it is very good laptop having slim and stylish design overall i would suggest u that you can buy this laptop.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,Good product.. Liked it. But camera is not good.
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"From the first day battery had degradation ..discharges quickly.. had an issue with external display connectivity.. some light bleed issues on screen..then some charging issues// and then the system stopped working..and not turning on.. totally clueless! so all the pros about this device in the previous review get vanished in this review!  tried to get it replaced..but amazon has printed the wrong serial number on the warranty and invoice for verification(everyone do a check-up and get it corrected)...  had to return this.. a very troublesome return experience..but very possible I must say! Amazon is good and sometimes bad! and warranty service will not be easy though it is available at the service center by visiting..  i have a surface pro for the past 4 years.. even though the display(screen flickering) had an issue after 2 years of use...surface pro 4 was replaced with a new surface pro 7 ..free of cost by Microsoft, picked up the defective device, and delivered a new device to home, no need to go anywhere!.. they even provided a replacement for an upgraded new 65watt charger and surface pen.. now that's superb customer service..maybe the best! that too during pandemic and lockdown!  I liked Fujitsu UH-X a lot on the first impression.. but it seems this light 2 in 1 notebook is not for the long haul..maybe my bad luck! The upcoming Fujitsu tablet Lifebook u9311x also looks impressive with thunderbolt 4, palm reader,4G LTE, smart card reader features. Hoping for the best!  Hp envy x360 is heavier... but performance is top-notch with AMD! Even without a thunderbolt port connects two external monitors easily. Easy 10-hour non-stop battery backup too!  will rest in peace for a while..before thinking of getting a new lappy to be happy!"
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"An awesome product. I never knew that a laptop can be this fast and light. I am an author and a wildlife photographer. Was waiting for a laptop that is portable but with no compromises and not from China. This is so light and performs like a machine! I am just overwhelmed with this beast, give me some time to recover. This is just the first week of using this from India.  Pros: Ultra light, ultra fast, all the other ultras  Cons: Resolution of the screen, old age cameras"
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"This is my first Fujitsu device and I am already a fan of this brand; best possible laptop in this small form factor. Using it from a week and I love this device already. I brought this for taking hand notes occasionally, while working for office. I am sure you will get lot of responses with Pro and cons in few days, but as an experience of using a premium device like this cant be expressed. You need need to touch and feel it to get the understanding of this device.  I liked the Pen and its holder within the laptop, and it does charging aswell.  Keyboard is as good as desktop keyboard with ample spacing and key response  Screen is crisp and clear with no reflection for outdoor usage.  Sound is a magic, right kind of output for laptop user without disturbing others  Had a initial hiccup with Wifi after first set of OS patches install, but it got fixed after driver upgrade; so no issues there.  Battery backup is showing 7+hrs and my expectation was more with this kind of price.  I choose this over Macbook Pro which misses on touchscreen and ports but world-class service; where as this device is full of different ports and service is still a concern for me. I did a quick search of support partners and seems only two service provider in my city (Bangalore), so hoping I don't get to use them.  Overall its a best laptop with minimal to no concerns. Go for it!!!"
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"This is my second laptop. Earlier one is Samsung and its 9 years old. There is small hinge problem with that otherwise working excellently till date. So I bought this. My requirement is only net surfing and storing my photos. So I can't say much about technicality. I found it very light and convenient for carrying. My observations: 1. Charges from 5% to 100% in about 1 hour 45 minutes. 2. It is set to shut down below 3% battery. 3. Starts in 15 seconds and shut down in just 1 second. Wow! 4. I run you tube video in loop in full HD mode and full brightness. With fully charged battery it ran for nearly 9 hours before draining completely. 5. I do not know if the type C port can be used for charging in future with appropriate charger. 6. Stylus working excellent. 7. Volume is good enough. 8. Good option for people on the Go, be it working or student."
Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"Cons: Battery: Battery performance is nothing as the company claims. Huge battery drainage Driver Updation: Their Website is missing when I wanted to update my drivers. Built up Quality: Looks great but lacks precision cuts near ports. Camera: Don't expect too much Clarity but good enough for a Zoom call Service Centre: You might face Service Issues if something goes wrong with your Laptop. This company doesn't have enough service centres in India. If somebody finds their Website, Kindly let me know.  Pros: Rest everything are pros!"

Fujitsu-33-78cm-Convertible-Graphics-4ZR1D71993,laptop,"Got this laptop as a gift on my Birthday. Could have been easily the best laptop money could buy given its excellent specs and features. The laptop is really light weight and feels as if one is holding a notebook.  However, the major area of concern is the battery. As against 11 hours claimed by Fujitsu, battery hardly lasts for 4-5 hours. This makes it difficult to work on this laptop for long. Even when commuting, I have to carry the charger should it tonk off.  Didn't expect this from a reputed brand like Fujitsu to claim wrong battery life and sell. I tried looking for optimizations and tried to reach out to Fujitsu, but to no avail.  If the battery issue can be resolved, it can easily be the best laptop."

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,I have buy this product in month of april 2021 and within 3months the few laptop keys are not working.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"At such price the laptop is good for basic office work and some online browsing work. Also good for students for online learning, teaching. Please verify first while purchasing the device for compatibility of software you are going to use. Also the warranty mentioned is from 28th September 2020 to 27th September 2021. But the device is purchased on 17th October 2020. And on 18th October after it received I have completed the first time registration process. So warrenty is there.

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"I brought this laptop and after just 10-12 days this laptop started showing slowness. It takes 20 minutes to just start and then you can start working.  Its worst than our desktop of year 1999-2000 era  When I tried checking the issue it’s showing disk utilisation 100% while I am having less than 100gb data in 1 TB CAPACITY hdd.  I have Mcafee Total protection license to protect this device which is recommended by Lenovo themselves.  I will never ever recommend such a useless product to even my enemy.  I have all laptops till date I brought from Lenovo but after this experience I must say I feel like getting cheated by LENOVO and dealer.  Its better not to sale such products which are not worth using a day.  DO NOT BUY EVEN YOU DONT CARE ABOUT MONEY, it’s as good as you are buying garbage for 22K."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,Laptop was awsome.packaging was good. .at this price range below 26k it's a best laptop.thank you Amazon.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"It was said it has ms office home and Student 2019 but it was not there in the laptop only the trial version given then I had to contact lenovo and microsoft for this, microsoft said that they need ms office home & student 2019 mentioned on the invoice also as on the invoice amazon has mentioned only ms office 2019. I faced lot of problems because of this u had to continuously call amazon, lenovo, microsoft on this issue. amazon was not ready to provide any confirmation at first whether it had ms office 2019 the finally after calling for two days I found one customer care executive in leadership team who helped me by sending me a mail which included all the details of the laptop plus she mentioned it has ms office home and Student 2019 then the prob got solved by the microsoft had to even fight with Microsoft too on this issue as it's not the customer's mistake that they trusted amazon. I'm buying it from Amazon not from a lenovo outlet. This caused me lot of problems and tension as they give only 7 days time for return/replacement also. Very bad service by Amazon but that Amazon's leadership executive's service was amazing I gave her five stars. And the laptop is very very slow it hangs also be careful before buying it."
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,Good laptop. Battery comes around 5hrs normal usage. Full charge from 10 to 100 takes around 2hrs. Performance is good. Looks premium. Boots very fast no lags. Overall good laptop.
Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"I bought this laptop for basic home tasks like Ms office, browsing and entertainment. Definitely no gaming purpose . So don't go for gaming although it has graphics AMD Radeon. Pros- 1. Convenient keyboard. Love it. 2. Dolby audio is superb. 3. Usb 3.0 port 4. 15.6 hd plus Good display 5. Comes with pre installed ms office 6. Light weight. 7. Doesn't heat up excessively. 8. Lenovo Vantage app is great.  Cons- 1. All usb ports are on left side as in photo but will do. 2. Front cam is vga. Very poor quality 3. Battery is inbuilt. Cannot detach without an expert 4. Battery is average. Don't expect too long to last. Maximum 3-4hrs on continuous usage. 5. Multi tasking is ok but not very good.  It is a value for money laptop when bought in Great indian festival."

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,From 4gb built in ram hardly 1 - 1.2 gb is free even when only single application is running. System hangs with continuous usage of 2hrs or if multiple applications are running. With additional 4gb ram laptop is working perfectly fine and response time is improved significantly. By getting additional ram for around 1.4k this laptop is still the best deal at 26k.

When i tried to couple of applications at the same time , it started to slow down so much you have to wait for mins for this to work.

Spend little more if you can afford and buy a worth product."

Lenovo-Ideapad-Windows-Platinum-81W100HKIN,laptop,"Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind."

HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,This is a good laptop for this price. But watch out while upgrading the ram. All specification sheet in Amazon and hp website say the ram is ddr4 2400MHz but actually it is ddr4 2666MHz.  I made this mistake and bought another 4gb ddr4 2400 MHz along with the laptop to upgrade it. To my surprise it is installed with ddr4 2666MHz.  I installed it. Though every works fine it is not desirable to mix variable frequency ram.  I also did install a hp 120gb nvme ssd as an upgrade and man everything is blazing fast.  You get a ₹55000/- laptop for about ₹36000/- by upgrading as such.  And I have asked hp service centre in my area and found that doing only this does not void your warranty.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Good product after upgrading to 12gb of ram (4 with laptop & I have added 8 gb) and m. 2 nvme ssd.  Boom...... Boots up in less than 2 seconds.  Only disappointed of screen resolution and mouse pad.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"""If any one is concerened about instalation of operating system on dos, go to the internet and someone has posted VIDEO OF INSTALLING OPERATING SYSTEM ON THIS SAME MODEL step by step""  As per one of the reviewer in this review section, the ram was 2666mhz instead of mentioned 2400mhz. He was absolutely correct. While the task manager showed ram frequency as 2400 mhz, on unscrewing the back panel, it turned out to smasung 2666mhz. So a big thank you to Arijit Nandi (review), he was the reason I pre ordered a 2666 mhz ram stick and it worked wonders for me.  The added ram stick gets a big bump in performance. HDD is alright and you have an option to add ssd as well.  Update all the driviers manually and the vega 8 graphics are on steroids.  There is a nudge with these models, where the speakers make cracking sound randomly and automatically. The touchpad being pathetic, I would recommend you to get a mouse and keyboard combo.  Here's my final take on this puppy;-  Charger 4/5 Display/Screen 3/5 Touchpad 1/5 Graphcs 5/5 Performance (cpu) 5/5 Speakers 2.9/5 Build quality 3/5 Value for money 5/5"
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Pros as you know APU and an m.2 slot for future upgradability Cons Screen color reproduction quite Poor Note that its 1366*768 not FHD Non IPS Panel Right side palm area heats annoyingly very much
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Amazon Delivery was fast and got this laptop within 2 days. I upgraded the laptop with 8GB Ram and a 250 GB SSD, Laptop supports 2666 MHz and have a M.2 Port. I got the Laptop at 29,990. After the upgrade My configuration is Ryzen 5/1 TB HDD/250GB SSD/12GB RAM - at around 35,000. If you know how to disassemble the laptop and put together the new RAM & SSD go for it. I don't know why this laptop has low reviews. Pros : Performance, Value for money. Cons: Body & Display."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Do not buy this product, Graphic memory mentioned 4GB, but it's only 512 MB."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,This is a DOS laptop which means u have to install ur windows once u buy it...  A good budget laptop....u can surely go for it...  Performance- for 30k its good....no cons  Battery life...if u r attending ur online class with video turned on it last upto 1.45 to2 hrs with fully charged...  Not the best of webcams but u will be okay with it...  I faced some issues with the head phone jack...it was not responding correctly...i have to restart the system and then it recognises... I dono whether it is with only mine...  That's all...a good budget laptop...
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"In stock hardware performance is average and worth money. If you upgrade this into 16gb ram and SSD performance will increase far better than previous. Price I brought is ₹29,990 and upgrade around ₹8,000 now this laptop performance much better then a ₹45,000 range laptop. RAM Support by laptop is 8gb 2400mhz but stock ram is samsung 4gb 2666mhz and laptop automatically config the ram speed to 2400. You can upgrade M.2 NVME (250gb) or replace HDD for high storage SSD."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"1. Delivery was within 24 hrs . Ordered at 6 pm Saturday and got the delivery at 5PM sunday. Excellent  2. Packing was secured and good  3. after one day performance , I feel its steal at this price  4. Laptop processing speed is good. It is ok for regular day to day work. May not be good for heavy gaming type things  5. It came with DOS so had to install Windows. It took 15-20 mins which was ok  6. So far found no lag in performance  7. Only negative aspect is plastic body :)"
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Brought it because I was impressed by its performance. Now regretted .after 5 months white dots started to appear on the screen. When I contacted hp customer care they denied giving the warranty and the white dot is increasing in size, never recommend hp to anyone in my life such pathetic customer service, I'm using the laptop with a lot of care yet the display is damaged. It is a manufacturing defect for sure."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"The laptop is value for money.. but with 4gb ram on HDD for windows 10 is damn slow .. but when I tried Ubuntu, its running smoothly. This laptop dosent allow to install windows 7. So, I recommend running linux on this machine rather than windows.... I think for this money if the manufacturer gives SSD rather than HDD it would be much better. Or if u want to use windows I definitely recommend to either upgrade ram or upgrade to SSD"
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"I got it for 30K and added additional 8 GB Ram module for 2.5 and 250 GB SSD for 2.4..so over all a laptop with 12 GB Ram and 1 TB HDD+250GB SSD costed me only 35K. Performance after new addition is much improved, now it takes only 8-10 seconds to boot. So far happy with laptops overall performance. It's slick and battery life is also almost 3+ hrs. Easy to install additional RAM and SSD."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Good product for the price one thing I can't believe in this laptop 2666mhz ram but the seller said it is 2400mhz ram why? And one thing the seller said wrong as it is FHD display but it is only HD backlit display please change the description only major cons is 1display,mouse pad other things are good even you can play GTA v by upgrading the ram atleast 8gb"
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"I have this laptop for more than six months and its working really fine and fast. Let me talk about this in a bit detail. So, I bought this one for nearly 31000 from amazon. I had to install windows and MS Office which is pretty easy. Laptop has an extra slot for RAM as well as SSD. In my suggestion you can add extra 4gb ram and 256gb ssd. You'll get a 45k laptop features in just nearly 35k. Bootup is very fast even without ssd. Display quality and size both is good. I myself am a beginner programmer and in my surprise this laptop handles even big software very smoothly. Battery backup is a bit less but in my opinion it shouldn't be a much of a problem. So, I'd suggest you to JUST GO FOR IT."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Go for it- 1. Performance 2. HP trust 3. hardware reliability 4. Budget gaming with 5k of upgrades nvme m.2 SSD & 4gb ddr4 2666Mhz RAM you make a 45k configuration 5.light weight Don't go for it- 1. annoying fan noise 2. good heater in winters ,i.e. higher operating temperature 3. Average display & body shell 5. basic looks 6. got only 10 month warranty on registration on HP  rest is good quality loud speakers, nice Webcam, good battery life up to 4hr"
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Best laptop at this price range till today(8jan 2021)
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,It's a great budget laptop. Have been using it for past 6 months and have played a lots of games and resource extensive apps on it. 4gb ram is an issue but can be upgraded later. Battery life is a little less but i can't complain as i mostly use it for gaming. Overall great laptop. You should buy it.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"It could have been a great laptop except for its battery life. The display is also small, 14"" is too straining. Battery also runs out fast."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Well it's worth buying but i found it a bit slow even with amd ryzen5 , i might have to add more ram around 4gb more to boost it up a bit..."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Getting a Ryzen5 Processor at this price is amazing. Works perfectly well and is the best laptop in my view at this price got it for ₹33999.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Performance not good
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,It could be better if RAM would be 8 GB or 256 GB SSD with hdd.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Best for gaming. Get more fast performance you need to install ssd hard drive and 8 gb ram.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Pc note working this time
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,1 major problem is plastic used in this laptop seems very thin & prone to break .....

HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Battery life is pretty good. But it just works for simple daily use. It can't handle heavy softwares. Heating like a IRON BOX & fan running always.....
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Buy an additional RAM and SSD and you got yourself a high performance laptop. Although I feel like display and viewing angles could be better.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Everything is ok sofar but screen is not as expected
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,I just love everything about it

HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Buil is somewhat poor.But performance and Upgradablity is very good.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Worst buy. Didn't get any warranty card and any information guide documents.. 👎
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Heating issue, called customer support but no resolution given yet"

HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,Mousepad doesnt work.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"For this price, it's an incredible laptop that can easily perform a lot of tasks (exceptions would be highly intensive task). If you have a 35k budget i would suggest to buy an M.2 ssd and an additional 4gb ram. It would be a perfect combination since there are no other laptops at this price with a Ryzen 5 3500U."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,At this price ssd & 8gb ram would be a better. Who buys 500gb hdd that too with 4gb ram only.
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"Guys purchase this machine and just add 6-7k extra for more 8gb RAM and 500gb SSD. MARK MY WORDS, this laptop will give you the experience of worth 55k laptops of the market at just 29+7=36k I don't understand sometimes how other people review and rate a specific product without understanding the depth. Ryzen 5 3500u with is much faster even than i5 11 th gen"
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,"It say that you will be getting a 41watthour charger, but i got 65wh charger which is good. I purchased the 4Gb ram and hhd variant after adding a 4GB ram it gives pretty good performance, and the dedicated video memory increases to 2GB from 512MB it gives max 51 fps in GTA 5 and average 46-47 fps. Yes you can render 4k videos in it after adding ram. But, To render 3min of 4k 60fps video at 63MBS it round about 4min. Overall it gives a great performance. Note- Battery backup is low 4 hours with normal usage, 2-3 hours in heavy usage, however it takes about 1-½ hour to fully charge. 3470Mah battery is given in this laptop."
HP-14-inch-5-3500U-Graphics-2D5Y6PA,laptop,In Feature & details column is says display is FHD whereas in product information column it says HD. What is the correct display resolution???????? Why sellers are updating incorrect or contradict information.

ASUS-E410MA-EK319T-Pentium-NumberPad-Warranty,laptop,"I am reviewing it based on my experience in past 7days :-  1.processor:- [8/10] It is a low end cpu can handle light work like browsing internet, taking class on zoom , for making ppt or word file not good for gaming or processor demanding work. cpu uses rose to 100% while I was running full scan and also i have to stop it at 20% since it is has taken 1hour to reach 20% and i have not opened any app . 2.RAM:-[9/10] For me 4gb ram was enough ram usage goes upto 95% but that was when i have opened 3 tabs of chrome , zoom ,adobe reader and file manager which is good for most budget users who does not do heavy work. Also you can add an extra ram since it has an empty slot for ram. 3.Display:- [10/10] full Hd display at this price range is treat to eyes you can watch 4k videos on youtube also the quality is also good. Its quality is same as 40k laptop so best in range and also this is my reason for going for this laptop. also the brightness is good for me i always kept at lowest while using indoor. thin and narrow side bezels. 4.storage :- [10/10] It have 256gb samsung ssd with very very good read and write spped [I will attach screenshot of crystaldisk score]. also about my personal experience i have observed 486mb/sec paste speed which is really very good also the boot time of laptop is under 10sec. I dont know about storage expansion but you can add external ssd or hdd if needed via type -C. 5.Build quality:- [9/10] It has plastic build but the quality is very good no flex and hinge is also good and you can open it 180degree which is also a plus point. it doesnot have vent for dissicipation of heat may be since it has low end cpu with low power. Its weight is just 1.3kg which is very good. 6.Battery:- [10/10] It has 42wh battery which is really good for such processor which consumes very low power. I have got battery backup of 8hrs continuous usage [6hrs zoom + 2hrs youtube] wwith 10% battery remainig pn better battery mode which is really good. 7.Port:- [8/10] About ports i have mixed feelings . it has 1 usb 3.0 port,1 usb 2.0,1 type-C, 3.5MM audio and mic combo, sd card reader and hdmi. here they should have given 1 extra usb 3.0 port then it is very good but this can be ignored as we can use adopters. 8.keyboard and trackpad:- [10/10] I am not good in typing also i don't know anything about this but as normal user i didnot find any problem while typing . Trackpad is also good with all gesture perfectly working also it hs build in numeric key which is good and responsive also u an use both numpad and touchpad simultaneously. 9. Webcam:- [6/10] Its webcam is not good at all if your usage includes webcam consider other laptop or external webcam 480p webcam. my usage does not need webcam so for me no problem with that 10 .OS and other software:- [8/10] it comes preinstalled with windows 10 home with lifetime validty which is good also it has one month free trial of mcfree antivirus and office preinstalled[not activated] which is not good they shuld have provided with office home and student .  OVERALL, [10/10] just go for it if you only need for online classes, assignments ppt, word, watching Youtube or any other streaming services, internet browsing. I don't know about coding. i got it for 26200rs which is pretty good for this laptop. THIS IS NOT ANY PROMOTED OR PAID REVIEW i have bought and giving feedback so that it might help others  TIP :- I have removed all bloatware apps and stopped background sevices on startup and then used it with latest window installed .  THANK YOU Will update if needed after using for some more time Update- it supports tpm so it can run windows 11 i checked it via app"
